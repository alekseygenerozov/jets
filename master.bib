	Abstract = {In this work we focus on the technical details of the numerical simulations of the non- thermal transient Swift J1644+57, whose emission is probably produced by a two-component jet powered by a tidal disruption event. In this context we provide details of the coupling between the relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and the radiative transfer code. First, we consider the technical demands of one-dimensional simulations of a fast relativistic jet, and show to what extent (for the same physical parameters of the model) do the computed light curves depend on the numerical parameters of the different codes employed. In the second part we explain the difficulties of computing light curves from axisymmetric two dimensonal simulations and discuss a procedure that yields an acceptable tradeoff between the computational cost and the quality of the results.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations of the spectral evolution and emission of radio components in relativistic jets. We compute jet models by means of a relativistic hydrodynamics code. We have developed an algorithm (SPEV) for the transport of a population of nonthermal electrons including radiative losses. For large values of the ratio of gas pressure to magnetic field energy density, alphaB ~ 6 × 104, quiescent jet models show substantial spectral evolution, with observational consequences only above radio frequencies. Larger values of the magnetic field (alphaB ~ 6 × 102), such that synchrotron losses are moderately important at radio frequencies, present a larger ratio of shocked-to-unshocked regions brightness than the models without radiative losses, despite the fact that they correspond to the same underlying hydrodynamic structure. We also show that jets with a positive photon spectral index result if the lower limit gammamin of the nonthermal particle energy distribution is large enough. A temporary increase of the Lorentz factor at the jet inlet produces a traveling perturbation that appears in the synthetic maps as a superluminal component. We show that trailing components can be originated not only in pressure matched jets, but also in overpressured ones, where the existence of recollimation shocks does not allow for a direct identification of such features as Kelvin-Helmholtz modes, and its observational imprint depends on the observing frequency. If the magnetic field is large (alphaB ~ 6 × 102), the spectral index in the rarefaction trailing the traveling perturbation does not change much with respect to the same model without any hydrodynamic perturbation. If the synchrotron losses are considered the spectral index displays a smaller value than in the corresponding region of the quiescent jet model.},

@article{Perucho+2012,
	Abstract = {Context. High-mass microquasars consist of a massive star and a compact object, the latter producing jets that will interact with the stellar wind. The evolution of the jets, and ultimately their radiative outcome, could depend strongly on the inhomogeneity of the wind, which calls for a detailed study.  Aims: The hydrodynamics of the interaction between a jet and a clumpy wind is studied, focusing on the global wind- and single clump-jet interplay.  Methods: We have performed, using the code Ratpenat, three-dimensional numerical simulations of a clumpy wind interacting with a mildly relativistic jet, and of individual clumps penetrating into a jet.  Results: For typical wind and jet velocities, filling factors of about ≳0.1 are already enough for the wind to be considered as clumpy. An inhomogeneous wind makes the jet more unstable when crossing the system. Kinetic luminosities ~1037 erg/s allow the jet to reach the borders of a compact binary with an O star, as in the smooth wind case, although with a substantially higher degree of disruption. When able to enter into the jet, clumps are compressed and heated during a time of about their size divided by the sound speed in the shocked clump. Then, clumps quickly disrupt, mass-loading and slowing down the jet.  Conclusions: We conclude that moderate wind clumpiness makes already a strong difference with the homogeneous wind case, enhancing jet disruption, mass-loading, bending, and likely energy dissipation in the form of emission. All this can have observational consequences at high-energies and also in the large-scale radio jets.},

@article{Araudo+2009,
	Abstract = {Context: High-mass microquasars are binary systems consisting of a massive star and an accreting compact object from which relativistic jets are launched. There is considerable observational evidence that winds of massive stars are clumpy. Individual clumps may interact with the jets in high-mass microquasars to produce outbursts of high-energy emission. Gamma-ray flares have been detected in some high-mass X-ray binaries, such as Cygnus X-1, and probably in LS 5039 and LS I+61 303. Aims: We predict the high-energy emission produced by the interaction between a jet and a clump of the stellar wind in a high-mass microquasar.  Methods: Assuming a hydrodynamic scenario for the jet-clump interaction, we calculate the spectral energy distributions produced by the dominant non-thermal processes: relativistic bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, for leptons, and for hadrons, proton-proton collisions.  Results: Significant levels of emission in X-rays (synchrotron), high-energy gamma rays (inverse Compton), and very high-energy gamma rays (from the decay of neutral pions) are predicted, with luminosities in the different domains in the range ~1032-1035 erg s-1. The spectral energy distributions vary strongly depending on the specific conditions. Conclusions: Jet-clump interactions may be detectable at high and very high energies, and provide an explanation for the fast TeV variability found in some high-mass X-ray binary systems. Our model can help to infer information about the properties of jets and clumpy winds by means of high-sensitivity gamma-ray astronomy.},

@article{ChoiWiita+2007,
	Abstract = {We have studied three-dimensional hydrodynamic interactions of relativistic extragalactic jets with two-phase ambient media. These jets propagate through a denser homogeneous gas and then impact clouds with densities 100 to 1000 times higher than the initial beam density. The deflection angle of the jet is influenced more by the density contrast of the cloud than by the beam Mach number of the jet. A relativistic jet with low relativistic beam Mach number can eventually be slightly bent after it crosses the dense cloud; however, we have not seen permanently bent structures in the interaction of a high relativistic beam Mach number jet with a cloud. The relativistic jet impacts on dense clouds do not necessarily destroy the clouds completely, and much of the cloud body can survive as a coherent blob. This enhancement of cloud durability is partly due to the geometric influence of the off-axis collisions we consider and also arises from the lower rate of cloud fragmentation through the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for relativistic jets. To compare our simulations with observed extragalactic radio jets, we have computed the approximate surface distributions of synchrotron emission at different viewing angles. These surface intensity maps show that relativistic jets interacting with clouds can produce synchrotron emission knots similar to structures observed in many VLBI-scale radio sources. We find that the synchrotron emission increases steeply at the moment of impact and the emission peaks right before the jet passes through the cloud.},

@article{WangWiita+2000,
	Abstract = {Three-dimensional simulations of hydrodynamic jets are computed at rather high resolution using the ZEUS-3D code. The parameters we employ are suitable for moderate-to-high-power radio jets emerging through a galactic atmosphere or halo and eventually crossing a tilted pressure-matched interface with a hotter intracluster medium. Before they cross this interface, these simulations aim the jets so that they hit massive clouds within the galactic halo, with densities 10 or more times higher than the ambient atmospheric density and hundreds to thousands times the jet density. Such clouds are set up with radii several times that of the jet and could correspond to giant molecular cloud complexes or small cannibalized galaxies. We find that while powerful jets eventually disperse the clouds, for off-center collisions, nonaxisymmetric instabilities are induced in those jets. Those instabilities grow faster for lower Mach number jets and can disrupt the jets substantially sooner than occurs for similar simulations of jets not hitting clouds. Such interactions could be related to some compact steep-spectrum source morphologies. Weak jets can be effectively halted or destroyed by reasonably massive clouds, and this type of interaction may have relevance for the paucity of extended radio jets in spiral galaxies. Slow, dense jets may be bent yet remain stable for fairly extended times, and such interactions can be responsible for some of the wide-angle tail and most of the ``dogleg'' radio source morphologies.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery and observations of the extremely luminous optical transient CSS100217:102913+404220 (CSS100217 hereafter). Spectroscopic observations showed that this transient was coincident with a galaxy at redshift z = 0.147 and reached an apparent magnitude of V ~ 16.3. After correcting for foreground Galactic extinction we determine the absolute magnitude to be MV = -22.7 approximately 45 days after maximum light. Over a period of 287 rest-frame days, this event had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 1.3 × 1052 erg based on time-averaged bolometric corrections of ~15 from V- and R-band observations. Analysis of the pre-outburst Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum of the source shows features consistent with a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy. High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope and Keck follow-up observations show that the event occurred within 150 pc of the nucleus of the galaxy, suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region. However, the rapid outburst along with photometric and spectroscopic evolution are much more consistent with a luminous supernova. Line diagnostics suggest that the host galaxy is undergoing significant star formation. We use extensive follow-up of the event along with archival Catalina Sky Survey NEO search and SDSS data to investigate the three most likely sources of such an event: (1) an extremely luminous supernova, (2) the tidal disruption of a star by the massive nuclear black hole, and (3) variability of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find that CSS100217 was likely an extremely luminous Type IIn supernova and occurred within the range of the narrow-line region of an AGN. We discuss how similar events may have been missed in past supernova surveys because of confusion with AGN activity.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We seek to obtain a coherent and realistic three-dimensional picture of the interstellar gas out to about 10 pc of the dynamical center of our Galaxy, which is supposed to be at Sgr A*.  Methods: We review the existing observational studies on the different gaseous components that have been identified near Sgr A*, and retain all the information relating to their spatial configuration and/or physical state. Based on the collected information, we propose a three-dimensional representation of the interstellar gas, which describes each component in terms of both its precise location and morphology and its thermodynamic properties.  Results: The interstellar gas near Sgr A* can be represented by five basic components, which are, by order of increasing size: (1) a central cavity with roughly equal amounts of warm ionized and atomic gases; (2) a ring of mainly molecular gas; (3) a supernova remnant filled with hot ionized gas; (4) a radio halo of warm ionized gas and relativistic particles; and (5) a belt of massive molecular clouds. While the halo gas fills ≈80% of the studied volume, the molecular components enclose ≈ 98% of the interstellar mass.},

@article{Nakar&Granot2007,
	Abstract = {In the standard forward shock model for gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow, the observed afterglow emission is synchrotron radiation from a quasi-spherical, adiabatic, self-similar, relativistic blast wave, that propagates into the external medium. This model predicts a smooth light curve where the flux scales as a power law in time, and may at most smoothly transition to a different power law. However, some GRB afterglow light curves show significant variability, which often includes episodes of rebrightening. Such temporal variability had been attributed in several cases to a large enhancement in the external density, or a density `bump', that is encountered by the self-similar adiabatic blast wave. Here we examine the effect of a sharp increase in the external density on the afterglow light curve in this scenario by considering, for the first time, a full treatment of both the hydrodynamic evolution and the radiation. To this end we develop a semi-analytic model for the light curve and carry out numerical simulations using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation code. Two spherically symmetric cases are explored in detail - a density jump in a uniform external medium (which is used to constrain the effect of a density clump) and a wind termination shock. We find that even a very sharp (modelled as a step function) and large (by a factor of a >> 1) increase in the external density does not produce sharp features in the light curve, and cannot account for significant temporal variability in GRB afterglows in the forward shock model. For a wind termination shock, the light curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic power laws over about one decade in time, and there is no rebrightening in the optical or X-rays that could serve as a clear observational signature. For a sharp jump in a uniform density profile, we find that the maximal deviation Deltaalphamax of the temporal decay index alpha from its asymptotic value (at early and late times) is bounded (e.g, Deltaalphamax < 0.4 for a = 10); Deltaalphamax slowly increases with a, converging to Deltaalphamax ~ 1 at very large a values. Therefore, no optical rebrightening is expected in this case as well. In the X-rays, while the asymptotic flux is unaffected by the density jump, the fluctuations in alpha are found to be comparable to those in the optical. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the origin of the observed fluctuations in several GRB afterglows.},

	Abstract = {Gamma-ray burst afterglow flares and rebrightenings of the optical and X-ray light curves have been attributed to both late-time inner engine activity and density changes in the medium surrounding the burster. To test the latter, we study the encounter between the relativistic blast wave from a gamma-ray burster and a stellar wind termination shock. The blast wave is simulated using a high-performance adaptive mesh relativistic hydrodynamic code, AMRVAC, and the synchrotron emission is analysed in detail with a separate radiation code. We find no bump in the resulting light curve, not even for very high density jumps. Furthermore, by analysing the contributions from the different shock wave regions we are able to establish that it is essential to resolve the blast wave structure in order to make qualitatively correct predictions on the observed output and that the contribution from the reverse shock region will not stand out, even when the magnetic field is increased in this region by repeated shocks. This study resolves a controversy in the recent literature.},

	Abstract = {The afterglow emission that follows gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) contains valuable information about the circumburst medium and, therefore, about the GRB progenitor. Theoretical studies of GRB blast waves, however, are often limited to simple density profiles for the external medium (mostly constant density and power-law R-k ones). We argue that a large fraction of long-duration GRBs should take place in massive stellar clusters where the circumburst medium is much more complicated. As a case study, we simulate the propagation of a GRB blast wave in a medium shaped by the collision of the winds of O and Wolf-Rayet stars, the typical distance of which is d˜ 0.1-1 pc. Assuming a spherical blast wave, the afterglow light curve shows a flattening followed by a shallow break on a time-scale from hours up to a week after the burst, which is a result of the propagation of the blast wave through the shocked wind region. If the blast wave is collimated, the jet break may, in some cases, become very pronounced with the post-break decline of the light curve as steep as t-5. Inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons from the nearby star off energetic electrons in the blast wave leads to a bright ˜GeV afterglow flare that may be detectable by Fermi.},

	Abstract = {We present ground-based and Swift photometric and spectroscopic observations of the candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li, found at the centre of PGC 043234 (d ~= 90 Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). The source had a peak bolometric luminosity of L ~= 1044 erg s-1 and a total integrated energy of E ~= 7 × 1050 erg radiated over the ˜6 months of observations presented. The UV/optical emission of the source is well fitted by a blackbody with roughly constant temperature of T ˜ 35 000 K, while the luminosity declines by roughly a factor of 16 over this time. The optical/UV luminosity decline is broadly consistent with an exponential decline, L∝ e^{-t/t_0}, with t0 ~= 60 d. ASASSN-14li also exhibits soft X-ray emission comparable in luminosity to the optical and UV emission but declining at a slower rate, and the X-ray emission now dominates. Spectra of the source show broad Balmer and helium lines in emission as well as strong blue continuum emission at all epochs. We use the discoveries of ASASSN-14li and ASASSN-14ae to estimate the TDE rate implied by ASAS-SN, finding an average rate of r ~= 4.1 × 10-5 yr-1 per galaxy with a 90 per cent confidence interval of (2.2-17.0) × 10-5 yr-1 per galaxy. ASAS-SN found roughly 1 TDE for every 70 Type Ia supernovae in 2014, a rate that is much higher than that of other surveys.},

	Abstract = {We analyze deep near-IR adaptive optics imaging (taken with NAOS/CONICA on the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, Chile), as well as new proper-motion data of the nuclear star cluster of the Milky Way. The surface density distribution of faint (H<=20, Ks<=19) stars peaks within 0.2" of the black hole candidate Sgr A*. The radial density distribution of this stellar ``cusp'' follows a power law of exponent alpha~1.3-1.4. The K-band luminosity function of the overall nuclear stellar cluster (within 9'' of Sgr A*) resembles that of the large-scale Galactic bulge but shows an excess of stars at Ks<=14. It fits population synthesis models of an old, metal-rich stellar population with a contribution from young, early, and late-type stars at the bright end. In contrast, the cusp within <=1.5" of Sgr A* appears to have a featureless luminosity function, suggesting that old, low-mass, horizontal-branch/red-clump stars are lacking. Likewise, there appear to be fewer late-type giants. The innermost cusp also contains a group of moderately bright, early-type stars that are tightly bound to the black hole. We interpret these results as evidence that the stellar properties change significantly from the outer cluster (>=a few arcseconds) to the dense innermost region around the black hole. We find that most of the massive early-type stars at distances of 1"-10" from Sgr A* are located in two rotating and geometrically thin disks. These disks are inclined at large angles and counterrotate with respect to each other. Their stellar content is essentially the same, indicating that they formed at the same time. We conclude that of the possible formation scenarios for these massive stars the most probable one is that 5-8 million years ago two clouds fell into the center, collided, were shock compressed, and then formed two rotating (accretion) disks orbiting the central black hole. For the OB stars in the central arcsecond, on the other hand, a stellar merger model is the most appealing explanation. These stars may thus be ``super-blue stragglers,'' formed and ``rejuvenated'' through mergers of lower mass stars in the very dense (>=108 Msolar pc-3) environment of the cusp. The ``collider model'' also accounts for the lack of giants within the central few arcseconds. The star closest to Sgr A* in 2002, S2, exhibits a 3.8 mum excess. We propose that the mid-IR emission comes either from the accretion flow around the black hole itself or from dust in the accretion flow that is heated by the ultraviolet emission of S2.},

	Abstract = {We present spatially resolved imaging and integral field spectroscopy data for 450 cool giant stars within 1 pc from Sgr A*. We use the prominent CO bandheads to derive effective temperatures of individual giants. Additionally we present the deepest spectroscopic observation of the Galactic center (GC) so far, probing the number of B9/A0 main-sequence stars (2.2-2.8 M sun) in two deep fields. From spectrophotometry we construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the red giant population and fit the observed diagram with model populations to derive the star formation history of the nuclear cluster. We find (1) that the average nuclear star formation rate dropped from an initial maximum ~10 Gyr ago to a deep minimum 1-2 Gyr ago and increased again during the last few hundred Myrs, (2) that roughly 80% of the stellar mass formed more than 5 Gyr ago, and (3) that mass estimates within R ~ 1 pc from Sgr A* favor a dominant star formation mode with a "normal" Chabrier/Kroupa initial mass function for the majority of the past star formation in the GC. The bulk stellar mass seems to have formed under conditions significantly different from the young stellar disks, perhaps because at the time of the formation of the nuclear cluster the massive black hole and its sphere of influence were much smaller than today.

@article{Li+2009,
	Abstract = {We present a multiwavelength investigation of the circumnuclear environment of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), utilizing archival Chandra, FUSE, GALEX, HST and Spitzer data as well as ground-based observations. Based on the Chandra/ACIS data, we tightly constrain the X-ray luminosity of M31*, the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the galaxy, to be L0.3-7keV <~ 1.2 × 1036ergs-1, approximately one part per 1010 of the Eddington luminosity. From the diffuse X-ray emission, we characterize the circumnuclear hot gas with a temperature of ~0.3 keV and a density of ~0.1cm-3. In the absence of an active SMBH and recent star formation, the most likely heating source for the hot gas is Type Ia supernovae (SNe). The presence of cooler, dusty gas residing in a nuclear spiral has long been known in terms of optical line emission and extinction. We further reveal the infrared emission of the nuclear spiral and evaluate the relative importance of various possible ionizing sources. We show evidence for interaction between the nuclear spiral and the hot gas, probably via thermal evaporation. This mechanism lends natural understandings to (1) the inactivity of M31*, in spite of a probably continuous supply of gas from outer disc regions and (2) the launch of a bulge outflow of hot gas, primarily mass-loaded from the circumnuclear regions. One particular prediction of such a scenario is the presence of gas with intermediate temperatures arising from the conductive interfaces. The FUSE observations do show strong OVIlambda1032 and lambda1038 absorption lines against the bulge starlight, but the effective column density, NOVI ~ 4 × 1014cm-2, may be attributed to foreground gas located in the bulge and/or the highly inclined disc of M31, leaving the amount of circumnuclear gas with intermediate temperatures largely uncertain. Our study strongly argues that stellar feedback, particularly in the form of energy release from SNe Ia, may play an important role in regulating the evolution of SMBHs and the interstellar medium in galactic bulges.},

	Abstract = {Mergers of neutron-star/neutron-star binaries are strong sources of gravitational waves. They can also launch subrelativistic and mildly relativistic outflows and are often assumed to be the sources of short gamma-ray bursts. An electromagnetic signature that persisted for weeks to months after the event would strengthen any future claim of a detection of gravitational waves. Here we present results of calculations showing that the interaction of mildly relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium produces radio flares with peak emission at 1.4 gigahertz that persist at detectable (submillijansky) levels for weeks, out to a redshift of 0.1. Slower subrelativistic outflows produce flares detectable for years at 150 megahertz, as well as at 1.4 gigahertz, from slightly shorter distances. The radio transient RT 19870422 (ref. 11) has the properties predicted by our model, and its most probable origin is the merger of a compact neutron-star/neutron-star binary. The lack of radio detections usually associated with short gamma-ray bursts does not constrain the radio transients that we discuss here (from mildly relativistic and subrelativistic outflows) because short gamma-ray burst redshifts are typically >0.1 and the appropriate timescales (longer than weeks) have not been sampled.},

@article{Leventis+2012,
	Abstract = {We present analytic flux prescriptions for broad-band spectra of self-absorbed and optically thin synchrotron radiation from gamma-ray burst afterglows, based on 1D relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. By treating the evolution of critical spectrum parameters as a power-law break between the ultrarelativistic and non-relativistic asymptotic solutions, we generalize the prescriptions to any observer time. Our aim is to provide a set of formulas that constitutes a useful tool for accurate fitting of model parameters to observational data, regardless of the dynamical phase of the outflow. The applicability range is not confined to gamma-ray burst afterglows, but includes all spherical outflows (also jets before the jet-break) that produce synchrotron radiation as they adiabatically decelerate in a cold, power-law medium. We test the accuracy of the prescriptions and show that numerical evidence suggests that typical relative errors in the derivation of physical quantities are about 10 per cent. A software implementation of the presented flux prescriptions combined with a fitting code is freely available on request and online.1 Together they can be used in order to directly fit model parameters to data.},

@article{Brown+2016,
	Abstract = {We use an extensive suite of numerical simulations to constrain the mass and orbit of Planet Nine, the recently proposed perturber in a distant eccentric orbit in the outer solar system. We compare our simulations to the observed population of aligned eccentric high semimajor axis Kuiper belt objects and determine which simulation parameters are statistically compatible with the observations. We find that only a narrow range of orbital elements can reproduce the observations. In particular, the combination of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and mass of Planet Nine strongly dictates the semimajor axis range of the orbital confinement of the distant eccentric Kuiper belt objects. Allowed orbits, which confine Kuiper belt objects with semimajor axis beyond 230 AU, have perihelia roughly between 200 and 350 AU, semimajor axes between 300 and 900 AU, and masses of approximately 10 Earth masses. Orbitally confined objects also generally have orbital planes similar to that of the planet, suggesting that the planet is inclined approximately 30 degrees to the ecliptic. We compare the allowed orbital positions and estimated brightness of Planet Nine to previous and ongoing surveys which would be sensitive to the planet's detection and use these surveys to rule out approximately two-thirds of the planet's orbit. Planet Nine is likely near aphelion with an approximate brightness of $22<V<25$. At opposition, its motion, mainly due to parallax, can easily be detected within 24 hours.},

The soft X-ray properties of the nucleus of NGC 5905 derived from the RASS observations, namely high-amplitude flux variability on timescales of days, the extremely soft spectrum (photon index {GAMMA}=4), and high peak luminosity of L_X_=7x10^42^ergs/s, are all inconsistent with its optical classification as HII-type, i.e. starburst galaxy. During the pointed observations taken two years later, the X-ray luminosity was down by a factor of >80. Possible mechanisms, which can produce the high state, are discussed. Tidal disruption of a star near a central black hole is in good agreement with the observations.},

	Abstract = {We present two luminous UV/optical flares from the nuclei of apparently inactive early-type galaxies at z = 0.37 and 0.33 that have the radiative properties of a flare from the tidal disruption of a star. In this paper we report the second candidate tidal disruption event discovery in the UV by the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey and present simultaneous optical light curves from the CFHTLS Deep Imaging Survey for both UV flares. The first few months of the UV/optical light curves are well fitted with the canonical t-5/3 power-law decay predicted for emission from the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted star. Chandra ACIS X-ray observations during the flares detect soft X-ray sources with Tbb = (2--5) × 105 K or Gamma > 3 and place limits on hard X-ray emission from an underlying AGN down to LX(2--10 keV) lesssim 1041 ergs s-1. Blackbody fits to the UV/optical spectral energy distributions of the flares indicate peak flare luminosities of gtrsim1044-1045 ergs s-1. The temperature, luminosity, and light curves of both flares are in excellent agreement with emission from a tidally disrupted main-sequence star onto a central black hole of several times 107 M☉. The observed detection rate of our search over ~2.9 deg2 of GALEX Deep Imaging Survey data spanning from 2003 to 2007 is consistent with tidal disruption rates calculated from dynamical models, and we use these models to make predictions for the detection rates of the next generation of optical synoptic surveys.  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

	Abstract = {A supermassive black hole in the nucleus of a galaxy will be revealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces and a flare of radiation is emitted by the stream of stellar debris that plunges into the black hole. Since common active galactic nuclei have accreting black holes that can also produce flares, a convincing demonstration that a stellar tidal disruption has occurred generally begins with a ``normal'' galaxy that has no evidence of prior nuclear activity. Here we report a luminous UV flare from an elliptical galaxy at z=0.37 in the Groth field of the GALEX Deep Imaging Survey that has no evidence of a Seyfert nucleus from optical spectroscopy and X-ray imaging obtained during the flare. Multiwavelength data collected at the time of the event, and for 2 years following, allow us to constrain, for the first time, the spectral energy distribution of a candidate tidal disruption flare from optical through X-rays. The luminosity and temperature of the radiation and the decay curve of the flare are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for the tidal disruption of a star, and provide the strongest empirical evidence for a stellar disruption event to date.},

	Abstract = {A dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will be revealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, and a flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of the stellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. Although the tidal disruption of a star is a rare event in a galaxy, ≈10-4 yr-1, observational candidates have emerged in all-sky X-ray and deep ultraviolet (UV) surveys in the form of luminous UV/X-ray flares from otherwise quiescent galaxies. Here we present the third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Deep Imaging Survey: a 1.6 × 1043 erg s-1 UV/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.1855. The UV/optical spectral energy distribution (SED) during the peak of the flare measured by GALEX and Palomar Large Field Camera imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody with T bb = 1.7 × 105 K and a bolometric luminosity of 3 × 1045 erg s-1, assuming an internal extinction with E(B - V)gas = 0.3. The Chandra upper limit on the X-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, LX (2 - 10 keV)<1041 erg s-1, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios of UV to X-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. We compare the light curves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidates discovered by GALEX, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by the power-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disrupted solar-type star and (2) the UV/optical SEDs can be attributed to thermal emission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidal disruption radius of a ≈107 M sun central black hole. We use the observed peak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5>Mg > - 18.9) to predict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.},

@article{Stern+2004,
	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a transient source in the central regions of galaxy cluster A267. The object, which we call ``PALS-1,'' was found in a survey aimed at identifying highly magnified Lyman break galaxies in the fields of intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the source had Un>24.7 (2 sigma AB), g=21.96+/-0.12, and very blue g-r and r-i colors; i.e., PALS-1 was a ``U-band dropout,'' characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at z~3. However, 3 months later the source had faded by more than 3 mag. Further observations showed a continued decline in luminosity, to R>26.4 at 7 months after discovery. Although the apparent brightness suggests a supernova at roughly the cluster redshift, we show that the photometry and light curve argue against any known type of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy distribution and location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent with the hypothesis that PALS-1 is a gravitationally lensed transient at z~3.3. If this interpretation is correct, the source is magnified by a factor of 4-7, and two counterimages are predicted. Our lens model predicts that there are time delays between the three images of 1-10 yr and that we have witnessed the final occurrence of the transient. The intense luminosity (MAB~-23.5 after correcting for lensing) and blue UV continuum (implying T>~50,000 K) argue that the source may have been a flare resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a 106-108 Msolar black hole. Regardless of its physical nature, PALS-1 highlights the importance of monitoring regions of high magnification in galaxy clusters for distant time-varying phenomena.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.  Based on observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the California Institute of Technology and the University of California.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, luminous X-ray outbursts with variability amplitudes as high as ~400 have been serendipitously detected from a small number of active and inactive galaxies. These outbursts may result from the tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes, as well as accretion disk instabilities. In order to place the first reliable constraints on the rate of such outbursts in the universe and to test the stellar tidal disruption hypothesis, we have performed a systematic and complete survey for them by cross-correlating ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and pointed Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data. We have detected five galaxies that were in outburst during the RASS, three of which show no signs of nuclear activity; these objects had been reported on individually in previous studies. After making reasonable corrections for the complicated selection effects, we conclude that the rate of large-amplitude X-ray outbursts from inactive galaxies in the local universe is ~9.1×10-6 galaxy-1 yr-1. This rate is consistent with the predicted rate of stellar tidal disruption events in such galaxies. When only the two active galaxies are considered, we find a rate for active galaxies of ~8.5×10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1. In order to place tighter constraints on these rates, additional outbursts must be detected.},

	Abstract = {Theory suggests that a star making a close passage by a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy can under most circumstances be expected to emit a giant flare of radiation as it is disrupted and a portion of the resulting stream of shock-heated stellar debris falls back onto the black hole itself. We examine the first results of an ongoing archival survey of galaxy clusters using Chandra and XMM-Newton-selected data and report a likely tidal disruption flare from SDSS J131122.15-012345.6 in A1689. The flare is observed to vary by a factor of gsim30 over at least two years to have maximum LX (0.3-3.0 keV) >~ 5 × 1042 erg s-1 and to emit as a blackbody with kT ~ 0.12 keV. From the galaxy population as determined by existing studies of the cluster, we estimate a tidal disruption rate of 1.2 × 10-4 galaxy-1 yr-1 if we assume a contribution to the observable rate from galaxies whose range of luminosities corresponds to a central black hole mass (M *) between 106 and 108 M sun.},

@article{Saxton+2012,
	Abstract = {Aims: The study of tidal disruption flares from galactic nuclei has historically been hampered by a lack of high quality spectral observations taken around the peak of the outburst. Here we introduce the first results from a program designed to identify tidal disruption events at their peak by making near-real-time comparisons of the flux seen in XMM-Newton slew sources with that seen in ROSAT.  Methods: Flaring extragalactic sources, which do not appear to be AGN, are monitored with Swift and XMM-Newton to track their temporal and spectral evolution. Timely optical observations are made to monitor the reaction of circumnuclear material to the X-ray flare.  Results: SDSS J120136.02+300305.5 was detected in an XMM-Newton slew from June 2010 with a flux 56 times higher than an upper limit from ROSAT, corresponding to LX ~ 3 × 1044 erg s-1. It has the optical spectrum of a quiescent galaxy (z = 0.146). Overall the X-ray flux has evolved consistently with the canonical t-5/3 model, expected for returning stellar debris, fading by a factor ~300 over 300 days. In detail the source is very variable and became invisible to Swift between 27 and 48 days after discovery, perhaps due to self-absorption. The X-ray spectrum is soft but is not the expected tail of optically thick thermal emission. It may be fit with a Bremsstrahlung or double-power-law model and is seen to soften with time and declining flux. Optical spectra taken 12 days and 11 months after discovery indicate a deficit of material in the broad line and coronal line regions of this galaxy, while a deep radio non-detection implies that a jet was not launched during this event.  Partly based on observations collected at the German-Spanish Astronomical Center, Calar Alto, jointly operated by the Max-Planck-institut f{\"u}r Astronomie Heidelberg and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC) and observations made with the WHT operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac Newton Group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Canarias.},

	Abstract = {We present ground-based and Swift photometric and spectroscopic observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-15oi, discovered at the center of 2MASX J20390918-3045201 ($d\simeq216$ Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN). The source peaked at a bolometric luminosity of $L\simeq1.9\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ and radiated a total energy of $E\simeq5.0\times10^{50}$ ergs over the $\sim3.5$ months of observations. The early optical/UV emission of the source can be fit by a blackbody with temperature increasing from $T\sim2\times10^4$ K to $T\sim6\times10^4$ K while the luminosity declines from $L\simeq1.9\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ to $L\simeq2.8\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, requiring the photosphere to be shrinking rapidly. The optical/UV luminosity decline is broadly consistent with an exponential decline, $L\propto e^{-t/t_0}$, with $t_0\simeq35$ days. ASASSN-15oi also exhibits roughly constant soft X-ray emission that is significantly weaker than the optical/UV emission. Spectra of the source show broad helium emission lines and strong blue continuum emission in early epochs, although these features fade rapidly and are not present $\sim3$ months after discovery. The early spectroscopic features and color evolution of ASASSN-15oi are consistent with a TDE, but the rapid spectral evolution is unique among optically-selected TDEs.},

@article{Vinko+2015,
	Abstract = {We present follow-up observations of an optical transient (OT) discovered by ROTSE on 2009 January 21. Photometric monitoring was carried out with ROTSE-IIIb in the optical and Swift in the UV up to +70 days after discovery. The light curve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over the next 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56Ni---56Co radioactive decay. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 database contains a faint, red object at the position of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of evidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object is likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the 9.2 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope between +8 and +45 days after discovery revealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A few weak features that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlying host. Fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy revealed a redshift of z = 0.19. At this redshift, the peak magnitude of the OT is close to -22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however, the lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death hypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal disruption of a Sun-like star by the central supermassive black hole. We argue that this transient likely belongs to a class of super-Eddington tidal disruption events.},

	Abstract = {The deepest XMM-Newton mosaic map of the central 1.5 $\,^{\circ}$ of the Galaxy is presented, including a total of about 1.5 Ms of EPIC-pn cleaned exposures in the central 15 arcsec and about 200 ks outside. This compendium presents broad-band X-ray continuum maps, soft X-ray intensity maps, a decomposition into spectral components and a comparison of the X-ray maps with emission at other wavelengths. Newly discovered extended features, such as supernova remnants (SNRs), superbubbles and X-ray filaments are reported. We provide an atlas of extended features within $\pm$1$\,^{\circ}$ of Sgr A*. We discover the presence of a coherent X-ray-emitting region peaking around G0.1-0.1 and surrounded by the ring of cold, mid-IR-emitting material known from previous work as the `Radio Arc Bubble' and with the addition of the X-ray data now appears to be a candidate superbubble. Sgr A's bipolar lobes show sharp edges, suggesting that they could be the remnant, collimated by the circumnuclear disc, of an SN explosion that created the recently discovered magnetar, SGR J1745-2900. Soft X-ray features, most probably from SNRs, are observed to fill holes in the dust distribution, and to indicate a direct interaction between SN explosions and Galactic centre (GC) molecular clouds. We also discover warm plasma at high Galactic latitude, showing a sharp edge to its distribution that correlates with the location of known radio/mid-IR features such as the `GC Lobe'. These features might be associated with an inhomogeneous hot `atmosphere' over the GC, perhaps fed by continuous or episodic outflows of mass and energy from the GC region.},

@article{Aird+2012,
	Abstract = {We present evidence that the incidence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the distribution of their accretion rates do not depend on the stellar masses of their host galaxies, contrary to previous studies. We use hard (2-10 keV) X-ray data from three extragalactic fields (XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and ELAIS-S1) with redshifts from the Prism Multi-object Survey to identify 242 AGNs with L 2-10 keV = 1042-44 erg s-1 within a parent sample of ~25,000 galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.0 over ~3.4 deg2 and to i ~ 23. We find that although the fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN at fixed X-ray luminosity rises strongly with stellar mass, the distribution of X-ray luminosities is independent of mass. Furthermore, we show that the probability that a galaxy will host an AGN can be defined by a universal Eddington ratio distribution that is independent of the host galaxy stellar mass and has a power-law shape with slope -0.65. These results demonstrate that AGNs are prevalent at all stellar masses in the range 9.5 and that the same physical processes regulate AGN activity in all galaxies in this stellar mass range. While a higher AGN fraction may be observed in massive galaxies, this is a selection effect related to the underlying Eddington ratio distribution. We also find that the AGN fraction drops rapidly between z ~ 1 and the present day and is moderately enhanced (factor ~2) in galaxies with blue or green optical colors. Consequently, while AGN activity and star formation appear to be globally correlated, we do not find evidence that the presence of an AGN is related to the quenching of star formation or the color transformation of galaxies.},

The formulae cover masses from 0.1 to 100 M_ and metallicities from Z=0.0001 to 0.03. Within this range the functions are everywhere strictly analytic. They take the form of rational functions in mass with only positive coefficients calculated as polynomials in metallicity. Errors are generally less than 7.5 per cent for luminosity and less than 5 per cent for radius. For a solar metallicity of Z=0.02 these errors are less than 3 per cent for luminosity and 1.2 per cent for radius.},

@article{Meynet+2005,
	Abstract = {Grids of models of massive stars (M >= 20 M&sun;) with rotation are computed for metallicities Z ranging from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to that of the Galactic Centre. The hydrostatic effects of rotation, the rotational mixing and the enhancements of the mass loss rates by rotation are included. The evolution of the surface rotational velocities of the most massive O-stars mainly depends on the mass loss rates and thus on the initial Z value. The minimum initial mass for a star for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase is lowered by rotation. For all metallicities, rotating stars enter the WR phase at an earlier stage of evolution and the WR lifetimes are increased, mainly as a result of the increased duration of the eWNL phase. Models of WR stars predict in general rather low rotation velocities (<50 km s-1) with a few possible exceptions, particularly at metallicities lower than solar where WR star models have in general faster rotation and more chance to reach the break-up limit. The properties of the WR populations as predicted by the rotating models are in general in much better agreement with the observations in nearby galaxies. Some possible remaining difficulties in these comparisons are mentioned. The evolution of the chemical abundances is largely influenced by rotation in all phases from the MS phase to the WN and WC phases. We also show that the interval of initial masses going through the LBV stage is changing with Z and Omega. The observed variation with metallicity of the fractions of type Ib/Ic supernovae with respect to type II supernovae as found by Prantzos & Boissier (\cite{Pr03}) is very well reproduced by the rotating models, while non-rotating models predict much too low ratios. This indicates that the minimum initial masses of single stars going through a WR phase are consistently predicted. At Z = 0.040, stars with initial masses above 50 M&sun; reach a final mass at the time of supernova explosion between 5 and 7.5 M&sun;, while at Z = 0.004, like in the SMC, the final masses of stars are in the range of 17-29 M&sun;. On the whole, rotation appears to be an essential parameter even for the WR properties. Detailed tables describing the evolutionary tracks are available on the web.},

The advanced diagnostic methods of stellar winds, including an assessment of the accuracy of the determinations of global stellar wind parameters (terminal velocities, mass-loss rates, wind momenta, and energies), are introduced and scaling relations as a function of stellar parameters are provided. Observational results are interpreted in the framework of the stationary, one-dimensional (1-D) theory of line-driven winds. Systematic effects caused by nonhomogeneous structures, time dependence, and deviations from spherical symmetry are discussed. The review finishes with a brief description of the role of stellar winds as extragalactic distance indicators and as tracers of the chemical composition of galaxies at high redshift.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of galactic nuclei reflects the presence of supermassive black holes (SBHs) in many ways. Single SBHs act as sinks, destroying a mass in stars equal to their own mass in roughly one relaxation time and forcing nuclei to expand. Formation of binary SBHs displaces a mass in stars roughly equal to the binary mass, creating low-density cores and ejecting hyper-velocity stars. Gravitational radiation recoil can eject coalescing binary SBHs from nuclei, resulting in offset SBHs and lopsided cores. We review recent work on these mechanisms and discuss the observable consequences.},

	Abstract = {We find that the majority of systems hosting multiple tidal disruptions (TDs) are likely to contain hard binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems, and also show that the rates of these repeated events are high enough to be detected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) over its lifetime. Therefore, these multiple TD events provide a novel method for identifying SMBH binary systems with parsec to subparsec separations. The rates of TDs are investigated using simulations of non-interacting stars initially orbiting a primary SMBH and the potential of the model stellar cusp. The stars are then evolved forward in time and perturbed by a secondary SMBH inspiraling from the edge of the cusp to its stalling radius. We find with conservative magnitude estimates that the next-generation transient survey LSST should detect multiple TDs in approximately three galaxies over five years of observation, though less conservative estimates could increase this rate by an order of magnitude.},

The process of stellar destruction by direct physical collisions is treated by use of the physical collision cross section. The two-dimensional steady-state distribution function, the density and velocity dispersion profiles of the stellar distribution, and stellar consumption rates are presented for black holes in globular cluster environments. The distribution function obtained is in reasonable agreement with that resulting from the Monte Carlo simulations of Shapiro and Marchant (1978); the present loss rate is larger than theirs by a factor of 2.},

The nature of the solution depends on the heavy-to-light stellar mass ratio MH /ML and on the unbound population number ratio NH /NL , through the relaxational coupling parameter Delta = 4NHM 2  H /[NLM 2  L (3 + MH /ML )]. When the heavy stars are relatively common (Delta Gt 1), they scatter frequently on each other. This efficient self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the stars form n∝ r^{-alpha_{M}} mass-dependent cusps near the MBH, with indices alpha H  = 7/4 for the heavy stars and 3/2 < alpha L  < 7/4 for the light stars (i.e. max(alpha H  - alpha L ) sime 1/4). However, when the heavy stars are relatively rare (Delta Lt 1), they scatter mostly on light stars, sink to the center by dynamical friction and settle into a much steeper cusp with 2 lsim alpha H  lsim 11/4, while the light stars form a 3/2 < alpha L  < 7/4 cusp, resulting in strong segregation (i.e., max(alpha H  - alpha L ) sime 1). We show that the present-day mass function of evolved stellar populations with a universal initial mass function (coeval or continuously star forming) separates into two distinct mass scales, ~1 M sun of main sequence and compact dwarfs, and ~10 M sun of stellar black holes (SBHs), and have Delta < 0.1. We conclude that it is likely that many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated. We review indications of strong segregation in observations of the Galactic center and in results of numeric simulations, and briefly list possible implications of a very high central concentration of SBHs around an MBH.},

@article{Antonini2014,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations as well as analytical techniques to study the long-term dynamical evolution of stellar black holes (BHs) at the Galactic center (GC) and to put constraints on their number and mass distribution. Starting from models that have not yet achieved a state of collisional equilibrium, we find that timescales associated with cusp regrowth can be longer than the Hubble time. Our results cast doubts on standard models that postulate high densities of BHs near the GC and motivate studies that start from initial conditions that correspond to well-defined physical models. For the first time, we consider the distribution of BHs in a dissipationless model for the formation of the Milky Way nuclear cluster (NC), in which massive stellar clusters merge to form a compact nucleus. We simulate the consecutive merger of ~10 clusters containing an inner dense sub-cluster of BHs. After the formed NC is evolved for ~5 Gyr, the BHs do form a steep central cusp, while the stellar distribution maintains properties that resemble those of the GC NC. Finally, we investigate the effect of BH perturbations on the motion of the GC S-stars as a means of constraining the number of the perturbers. We find that reproducing the quasi-thermal character of the S-star orbital eccentricities requires >~ 1000 BHs within 0.1 pc of Sgr A*. A dissipationless formation scenario for the GC NC is consistent with this lower limit and therefore could reconcile the need for high central densities of BHs (to explain the S-stars orbits) with the "missing-cusp" problem of the GC giant star population.},

@article{French+2016,
	Abstract = {Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are transient events observed when a star passes close enough to a supermassive black hole to be tidally destroyed. Many TDE candidates have been discovered in host galaxies whose spectra have weak or no line emission yet strong Balmer line absorption, indicating a period of intense star formation that has recently ended. As such, TDE host galaxies fall into the rare class of quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies. Here, we quantify the fraction of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with spectral properties like those of TDE hosts, determining the extent to which TDEs are over-represented in such galaxies. Galaxies whose spectra have Balmer absorption H$\delta_{\rm A}$ $-$ $\sigma$(H$\delta_{\rm A}$) $>$ 4 \AA\ (where $\sigma$(H$\delta_{\rm A}$) is the error in the Lick H$\delta_{\rm A}$ index) and H$\alpha$ emission EW $<$ $3$ \AA\ have had a strong starburst in the last $\sim$Gyr. They represent 0.2% of the local galaxy population, yet host 3 of 8 (37.5%) optical/UV-selected TDE candidates. A broader cut, H$\delta_{\rm A} >$ 1.31 \AA\ and H$\alpha$ EW $<$ $3$ \AA, nets only 2.3% of SDSS galaxies, but 6 of 8 (75%) optical/UV TDE hosts. Thus, quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies are over-represented among the TDE hosts by a factor of 33-190. The high-energy-selected TDE Swift J1644 also lies in a galaxy with strong Balmer lines and weak H$\alpha$ emission, implying a $>80\times$ enhancement in such hosts and providing an observational link between the $\gamma$/X-ray-bright and optical/UV-bright TDE classes.},

	Abstract = {We present surface photometry for the central regions of a sample of 48 spiral galaxies (mostly unbarred and barred of type Sbc or Sc) observed with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Surface brightness profiles (SBPs) were derived and modeled with a Nuker law. We also analyzed archival Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images with a larger field of view, which are available for 18 galaxies in our sample. We modeled the extracted bulge SBPs with an exponential, an r1/4, or an rn profile. In agreement with previous studies, we find that bulges of Sbc galaxies fall into two categories: bulges well described by an exponential profile and those well described by an r1/4 profile. Only one galaxy requires the use of a more general S{\'e}rsic profile to properly describe the bulge. Nuclear photometrically distinct components are found in ~55% of the galaxies. For those that we classify as star clusters on the basis of their resolved extent, we find absolute magnitudes that are brighter on average than those previously identified in spiral galaxies. This might be due to a bias in our sample toward star-forming galaxies, combined with a trend for star-forming galaxies to host brighter central clusters.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Simulations of hot, pressure-supported, tilted black hole accretion flows, in which the angular momentum of the flow is misaligned with the black hole spin axis, can exhibit two nonaxisymmetric shock structures in the inner regions of the flow. We analyze the strength and significance of these shock structures in simulations with tilt angles of 10$\,^{\circ}$ and 15$\,^{\circ}$. By integrating fluid trajectories in the simulations through the shocks and tracking the variations of fluid quantities along these trajectories, we show that these shocks are strong, with substantial compression ratios, in contrast to earlier claims. However, they are only moderately relativistic. We also show that the two density enhancements resembling flow streams in their shape are in fact merely post-shock compressions, as fluid trajectories cut across, rather than flow along, them. The dissipation associated with the shocks is a substantial fraction (sime 3%-12%) of the rest mass energy advected into the hole, and therefore comparable to the dissipation expected from turbulence. The shocks should therefore make order unity changes in the observed properties of black hole accretion flows that are tilted.},

	Abstract = {We have recently written a new code to simulate the long term evolution of spherical clusters of stars. It is based on the pioneering Monte Carlo scheme proposed by H{\'e}non in the 70's. Unlike other implementations of this numerical method which were successfully used to investigate the dynamics of globular clusters, our code has been devised in the specific goal to treat dense galactic nuclei. In a previous paper, we described the basic version of our code which includes 2-body relaxation as the only physical process. In the present work, we go on and include further physical ingredients that are mostly relevant to galactic nuclei, namely the presence of a central (growing) black hole (BH) and collisions between (main sequence) stars. Stars that venture too close to the BH are destroyed by the tidal field. We took particular care of this process because of its importance, both as a channel to feed the BH and a way to produce accretion flares from otherwise quiescent galactic nuclei. Collisions between stars have often been proposed as another mechanism to drive stellar matter into the central BH. Furthermore, non disruptive collisions may create peculiar stellar populations which are of great observational interest in the case of the central cluster of our Galaxy. To get the best handle on the role of this process in galactic nuclei, we include it with unpreceded realism through the use of a set of more than 10 000 collision simulations carried out with a SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) code. Stellar evolution has also been introduced in a simple way, similar to what has been done in previous dynamical simulations of galactic nuclei. To ensure that this physics is correctly simulated, we realized a variety of tests whose results are reported here. This unique code, featuring most important physical processes, allows million particle simulations, spanning a Hubble time, in a few CPU days on standard personal computers and provides a wealth of data only rivalized by N-body simulations.},

	Abstract = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole leads to a short-lived thermal flare. Despite extensive searches, radio follow-up observations of known thermal stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs) have not yet produced a conclusive detection. We present a detection of variable radio emission from a thermal TDF, which we interpret as originating from a newly-launched jet. The multi-wavelength properties of the source present a natural analogy with accretion state changes of stellar mass black holes, suggesting all TDFs could be accompanied by a jet. In the rest frame of the TDF, our radio observations are an order of magnitude more sensitive than nearly all previous upper limits, explaining how these jets, if common, could thus far have escaped detection.},

@article{Freitag+2006,
	Abstract = {The study of how stars distribute themselves around a massive black hole (MBH) in the center of a galaxy is an important prerequisite for the understanding of many galactic-center processes. These include the observed overabundance of point X-ray sources at the Galactic center and the prediction of rates and characteristics of tidal disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and of inspirals of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of high importance for the future space-borne gravitational wave interferometer LISA. In relatively small galactic nuclei hosting MBHs with masses in the range 105-107 Msolar, the single most important dynamical process is two-body relaxation. It induces the formation of a steep density cusp around the MBH and strong mass segregation, as more massive stars lose energy to lighter ones and drift to the central regions. Using a spherical stellar dynamical Monte Carlo code, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of galactic nucleus models with a spectrum of stellar masses. Our focus is the concentration of stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH. We quantify this mass segregation for a variety of galactic nucleus models and discuss its astrophysical implications. Special attention is given to models developed to match the conditions in the Milky Way nucleus; we examine the presence of compact objects in connection to recent high-resolution X-ray observations.},

@article{van-Velzen&Farrar2014,
	Abstract = {We report an observational estimate of the rate of stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs) in inactive galaxies based on a successful search for these events among transients in galaxies using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multi-epoch imaging data (Stripe 82). This search yielded 186 nuclear flares in galaxies, 2 of which are excellent TDF candidates. Because of the systematic nature of the search, the very large number of galaxies, the long time of observation, and the fact that non-TDFs were excluded without resorting to assumptions about TDF characteristics, this study provides an unparalleled opportunity to measure the TDF rate. To compute the rate of optical stellar tidal disruption events, we simulate our entire pipeline to obtain the efficiency of detection. The rate depends on the light curves of TDFs, which are presently still poorly constrained. Using only the observed part of the SDSS light curves gives a model-independent upper limit to the optical TDF rate, \dot{N}<2\times 10^{-4}\,yr^{-1}\,galaxy^{-1} (90% CL), under the assumption that the SDSS TDFs are representative examples. We develop three empirical models of the light curves based on the two SDSS light curves and two more recent and better-sampled Pan-STARRS TDF light curves, leading to our best estimate of the rate: \dot{N}_TDF = (1.5{--}2.0)_{-1.3}^{+2.7} \times 10^{-5} \,yr^{-1}\, galaxy^{-1}. We explore the modeling uncertainties by considering two theoretically motivated light curve models, as well as two different relationships between black hole mass and galaxy luminosity, and two different treatments of the cutoff in the visibility of TDFs at large M BH. From this we conclude that these sources of uncertainty are not significantly larger than the statistical ones. Our results are applicable for galaxies hosting black holes with mass in the range of a few 106-108 M &sun;, and translates to a volumetric TDF rate of (4-8) × 10-8 $\pm$ 0.4 yr-1 Mpc-3, with the statistical uncertainty in the exponent.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the correlations between the black hole mass $M_{BH}$, the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, the bulge mass $M_{Bu}$, the bulge average spherical density $\rho_h$ and its spherical half mass radius $r_h$, constructing a database of 97 galaxies (31 core ellipticals, 17 power-law ellipticals, 30 classical bulges, 19 pseudo bulges) by joining 72 galaxies from the literature to 25 galaxies observed during our recent SINFONI black hole survey. For the first time we discuss the full error covariance matrix. We analyse the well known \msig\ and \mbu\ relations and establish the existence of statistically significant correlations between $M_{Bu}$ and $r_h$ and anti-correlations between $M_{Bu}$ and $\rho_h$. We establish five significant bivariate correlations (\msigrho, \msigr, \mbus, \mburho, \mbur) that predict $M_{BH}$ of 77 core and power-law ellipticals and classical bulges with measured and intrinsic scatter as small as $\approx 0.36$ dex and $\approx 0.33$ dex respectively, or 0.26 dex when the subsample of 45 galaxies defined by \citet{KormendyHo2013} is considered. In contrast, pseudo bulges have systematically lower $M_{BH}$, but approach the predictions of all the above relations at spherical densities $\rho_h\ge 10^{10} M_\odot/kpc^3$ or scale lengths $r_h\le 1$ kpc. These findings fit in a scenario of co-evolution of BH and classical-bulge masses, where core ellipticals are the product of dry mergers of power-law bulges and power-law Es and bulges the result of (early) gas-rich mergers and of disk galaxies. In contrast, the (secular) growth of BHs is decoupled from the growth of their pseudo bulge hosts, except when (gas) densities are high enough to trigger the feedback mechanism responsible for the existence of the correlations between $M_{BH}$ and galaxy structural parameters.},

	Abstract = {The impending era of wide-field radio surveys has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of astrophysical transients. Here we evaluate the prospects of a wide range of planned and hypothetical radio surveys using the properties and volumetric rates of known and hypothetical classes of extragalactic synchrotron radio transients (e.g., on-axis and off-axis gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), supernovae, tidal disruption events, compact object mergers). Utilizing these sources and physically motivated considerations we assess the allowed phase space of radio luminosity and peak timescale for extragalactic transients. We also include for the first time effects such as redshift evolution of the rates, K-corrections, and non-Euclidean luminosity distance, which affect the detection rates of the most sensitive surveys. The number of detected events is calculated by means of a Monte Carlo method, using the various survey properties (depth, cadence, area) and realistic detection criteria that include a cut on the minimum variability of the transients during the survey and an assessment of host galaxy contamination. We find that near-term GHz frequency surveys (ASKAP/VAST, Very Large Array Sky Survey) will detect few events: ≲ 30-50 on- and off-axis long GRBs (LGRBs) and off-axis tidal disruption events, and ~ 50-100 neutron star binary mergers if ~ 0.5% of the mergers result in a stable millisecond magnetar. Low-frequency surveys (e.g., LOFAR) are unlikely to detect any transients, while a hypothetical large-scale mm survey may detect ~40 on-axis LGRBs. On the other hand, we find that SKA1 surveys at ~ 0.1-1 GHz have the potential to uncover thousands of transients, mainly on-axis and off-axis LGRBs, on-axis short GRBs, off-axis TDEs, and neutron star binary mergers with magnetar remnants.},

@article{Metzger+2011,
	Abstract = {Recent measurements by the Pierre Auger Observatory suggest that the composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) becomes dominated by heavy nuclei at high energies. However, until now there has been no astrophysical motivation for considering a source highly enriched in heavy elements. Here we demonstrate that the outflows from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) may indeed be composed primarily of nuclei with masses A˜ 40-200, which are synthesized as hot material expands away from the central engine. In particular, if the jet is magnetically dominated (rather than a thermally driven fireball) its low entropy enables heavy elements to form efficiently. Adopting the millisecond protomagnetar model for the GRB central engine, we show that heavy nuclei both are synthesized in protomagnetar winds and can in principle be accelerated to energies ≳1020 eV in the shocks or regions of magnetic reconnection that are responsible for powering the GRB. Similar results may apply to accretion-powered GRB models if the jet originates from a magnetized disc wind. Depending on the precise distribution of nuclei synthesized, we predict that the average primary mass may continue to increase beyond Fe group elements at the highest energies, possibly reaching the A≈ 90 (zirconium), A≈ 130 (tellurium) or even A≈ 195 (platinum) peaks. Future measurements of the UHECR composition at energies ≳1020 eV can thus confirm or constrain our model and, potentially, probe the nature of GRB outflows. The longer attenuation length of ultra-heavy nuclei through the extragalactic background light greatly expands the volume of accessible sources and alleviates the energetic constraints on GRBs as the source of UHECRs.},

	Abstract = {Passive red galaxies frequently contain warm ionized gas and have spectra similar to low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs). Here we investigate the nature of the ionizing sources powering this emission, by comparing nuclear spectroscopy from the Palomar survey with larger aperture data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find the line emission in the majority of passive red galaxies is spatially extended; the Halpha surface brightness profile depends on radius r as r -1.28. We detect strong line ratio gradients with radius in [N II]/Halpha, [S II]/Halpha, and [O III]/[S II], requiring the ionization parameter to increase outward. Combined with a realistic gas density profile, this outward increasing ionization parameter convincingly rules out active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as the dominant ionizing source and strongly favors distributed ionizing sources. Sources that follow the stellar density profile can additionally reproduce the observed luminosity dependence of the line ratio gradient. Post-asymptotic giant branch stars provide a natural ionization source candidate, though they have an ionization parameter deficit. Velocity width differences among different emission lines disfavor shocks as the dominant ionization mechanism, and suggest that the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains multiple components. We conclude that the line emission in most LINER-like galaxies found in large-aperture (>100 pc) spectroscopy is not primarily powered by AGN activity and thus does not trace the AGN bolometric luminosity. However, they can be used to trace warm gas in these red galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Relativistic blast waves can be described using a mechanical model. In this model, the ``blast''-the compressed gas between the forward and reverse shocks-is viewed as one hot body. Equations governing its dynamics are derived from the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. Simple analytical solutions are obtained in the two limiting cases of an ultrarelativistic and a nonrelativistic reverse shock. Equations are derived for the general explosion problem.},

	Abstract = {Rates of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) due to two-body relaxation are calculated using a large galaxy sample (N ~ 200) in order to explore the sensitivity of the TDE rates to observational uncertainties, such as the parametrization of galaxy light profiles and the stellar mass function. The largest uncertainty arises due to the poorly constrained occupation fraction of SMBHs in low-mass galaxies, which otherwise dominate the total TDE rate. The detection rate of TDE flares by optical surveys is calculated as a function of SMBH mass and other observables for several physically-motivated models of TDE emission. We also quantify the fraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the majority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington luminosities (such as disk winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis relativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly constrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission channels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much less pronounced in a flux-limited survey (although still present in a volume-complete event sample). The SMBH mass distribution of the current sample of TDEs, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects, already suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate.},

@article{Metzger&Stone2015,
	Abstract = {When a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive black hole (BH), roughly half of its mass falls back to the BH at super-Eddington rates. Being tenuously gravitationally bound and unable to cool radiatively, only a small fraction f_in << 1 of the returning debris will likely be incorporated into the disk and accrete, with the vast majority instead becoming unbound in an outflow of velocity ~1e4 km/s. This slow outflow spreads laterally, encasing the BH. For months or longer, the outflow remains sufficiently neutral to block hard EUV and X-ray radiation from the hot inner disk, which instead becomes trapped in a radiation-dominated nebula. Ionizing nebular radiation heats the inner edge of the ejecta to temperatures of T > few 1e4 K, converting the emission to optical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower opacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant effective temperatures of optically-discovered TDE flares. For BHs with relatively high masses M_BH > 1e7 M_sun the ejecta can become ionized at an earlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare which is instead dominated by thermal X-ray emission. We predict total radiated energies consistent with those of observed TDE flares, and ejecta velocities that agree with the measured emission line widths. The peak optical luminosity for M_BH < 1e6 M_sun is suppressed due to adiabatic losses in the inner disk wind, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in galaxies with low mass BHs. In the classical picture, where f_in ~ 1, TDEs de-spin supermassive BHs and cap their maximum spins well below theoretical accretion physics limits. This cap is greatly relaxed in our model, and existing Fe K-alpha spin measurements provide suggestive preliminary evidence that f_in < 1.},

	Abstract = {We present a catalogue of photometric and structural properties of 228 nuclear star clusters (NSCs) in nearby late-type disc galaxies. These new measurements are derived from a homogeneous analysis of all suitable Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) images in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive. The luminosity and size of each NSC are derived from an iterative point spread function (PSF) fitting technique, which adapts the fitting area to the effective radius (reff) of the NSC and uses a WFPC2-specific PSF model tailored to the position of each NSC on the detector. The luminosities of NSCs are <=108 LV, &sun;, and their integrated optical colours suggest a wide spread in age. We confirm that most NSCs have sizes similar to globular clusters (GCs), but find that the largest and brightest NSCs occupy the regime between ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) and the nuclei of early-type galaxies in the size-luminosity plane. The overlap in size, mass, and colour between the different incarnations of compact stellar systems provides a support for the notion that at least some UCDs and the most massive Galactic GCs may be remnant nuclei of disrupted disc galaxies. We find tentative evidence for the NSCs' reff to be smaller when measured in bluer filters and discuss possible implications of this result. We also highlight a few examples of complex nuclear morphologies, including double nuclei, extended stellar structures, and nuclear F606W excess from either recent (circum-)nuclear star formation and/or a weak active galactic nucleus. Such examples may serve as case studies for ongoing NSC evolution via the two main suggested mechanisms, namely cluster merging and in situ star formation.},

	Abstract = {We examine the detailed physics of the feedback mechanism by relativistic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets interacting with a two-phase fractal interstellar medium (ISM) in the kpc-scale core of galaxies using 29 three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical simulations. The feedback efficiency, as measured by the amount of cloud dispersal generated by the jet-ISM interactions, is sensitive to the maximum size of clouds in the fractal cloud distribution but not to their volume filling factor. Feedback ceases to be efficient for Eddington ratios P jet/L edd <~ 10-4, although systems with large cloud complexes >~ 50 pc require jets of Eddington ratio in excess of 10-2 to disperse the clouds appreciably. Based on measurements of the bubble expansion rates in our simulations, we argue that sub-grid AGN prescriptions resulting in negative feedback in cosmological simulations without a multi-phase treatment of the ISM are good approximations if the volume filling factor of warm-phase material is less than 0.1 and the cloud complexes are smaller than ~25 pc. We find that the acceleration of the dense embedded clouds is provided by the ram pressure of the high-velocity flow through the porous channels of the warm phase, flow that has fully entrained the shocked hot-phase gas it has swept up, and is additionally mass loaded by ablated cloud material. This mechanism transfers 10% to 40% of the jet energy to the cold and warm gas, accelerating it within a few 10 to 100 Myr to velocities that match those observed in a range of high- and low-redshift radio galaxies hosting powerful radio jets.},

	Abstract = {We present the catalog of X-ray sources detected in a shallow Chandra survey of the inner 2deg×0.8d of the Galaxy and in two deeper observations of the Radio Arches and Sgr B2. The catalog contains 1352 objects that are highly absorbed (NH>~4×1022 cm-2) and are therefore likely to lie near the Galactic center (D~8 kpc), and 549 less absorbed sources that lie within <~6 kpc of Earth. On the basis of the inferred luminosities of the X-ray sources and the expected numbers of various classes of objects, we suggest that the sources with LX<~1033 ergs s-1 that comprise ~90% of the catalog are cataclysmic variables and that the ~100 brighter objects are accreting neutron stars and black holes, young isolated pulsars, and Wolf-Rayet and O (WR/O) stars in colliding-wind binaries. We find that the spatial distribution of X-ray sources matches that of the old stellar population observed in the infrared, which supports our suggestion that most of the X-ray sources are old cataclysmic variables. However, we find that there is an apparent excess of ~10 bright sources in the Radio Arches region. That region is already known to be the site of recent star formation, so we suggest that the bright sources in this region are young high-mass X-ray binaries, pulsars, or WR/O star binaries. We briefly discuss some astrophysical questions that this catalog can be used to address.},

	Abstract = {We present direct constraints on how the formation of low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations in galactic fields depends on stellar age. In this pilot study, we utilize Chandra and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data to detect and characterize the X-ray point source populations of three nearby early-type galaxies: NGC 3115, 3379, and 3384. The luminosity-weighted stellar ages of our sample span ≈3-10 Gyr. X-ray binary population synthesis models predict that the field LMXBs associated with younger stellar populations should be more numerous and luminous per unit stellar mass than older populations due to the evolution of LMXB donor star masses. Crucially, the combination of deep Chandra and HST observations allows us to test directly this prediction by identifying and removing counterparts to X-ray point sources that are unrelated to the field LMXB populations, including LMXBs that are formed dynamically in globular clusters, Galactic stars, and background active galactic nuclei/galaxies. We find that the "young" early-type galaxy NGC 3384 (≈2-5 Gyr) has an excess of luminous field LMXBs (L X >~ (5-10) × 1037 erg s-1) per unit K-band luminosity (LK ; a proxy for stellar mass) than the "old" early-type galaxies NGC 3115 and 3379 (≈8-10 Gyr), which results in a factor of ≈2-3 excess of L X/LK for NGC 3384. This result is consistent with the X-ray binary population synthesis model predictions; however, our small galaxy sample size does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions on the evolution field LMXBs in general. We discuss how future surveys of larger galaxy samples that combine deep Chandra and HST data could provide a powerful new benchmark for calibrating X-ray binary population synthesis models.},

	Abstract = {Using a method to discover and classify supernovae (SNe) in galaxy spectra, we detect 91 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) and 16 Type II SNe (SNe II) among ˜740 000 galaxies of all types and ˜215 000 star-forming galaxies without active galactic nuclei, respectively, in Data Release 9 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Of these SNe, 15 SNe Ia and eight SNe II are new discoveries reported here for the first time. We use our SN samples to measure SN rates per unit mass as a function of galaxy stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR (sSFR), as derived by the MPA-JHU Galspec pipeline. We show that correlations between SN Ia and SN II rates per unit mass and galaxy stellar mass, SFR, and sSFR can be explained by a combination of the respective SN delay-time distributions (the distributions of times that elapse between the formation of a stellar population and all ensuing SNe), the ages of the surveyed galaxies, the redshifts at which they are observed, and their star formation histories. This model was first suggested by Kistler et al. for the SN Ia rate-mass correlation, but is expanded here to SNe II and to correlations with galaxy SFR and sSFR. Finally, we measure a volumetric SN II rate at redshift 0.075 of RII, V = 0.621^{+0.197}_{-0.154} (stat) ^{+0.024}_{-0.063} (sys) × 10^{-4} yr-1 Mpc-3. Assuming that SNe IIP and IIL account for 60 per cent of all core-collapse (CC) SNe, the CC SN rate is RCC, V = 1.04^{+0.33}_{-0.26} (stat) ^{+0.04}_{-0.11} (sys) × 10^{-4} yr-1 Mpc-3.},

@article{Alexander+2015,
	Abstract = {The tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBH) lights up dormant systems and can be used to probe accretion and outflow processes. Theoretical calculations indicate that most tidal disruption events (TDEs) lead to super-Eddington accretion, which in turn drives outflows. The discovery of luminous radio emission from the $\gamma$-ray TDE Sw J1644+57 revealed the formation of a relativistic jetted outflow, but such events represent $\lesssim 1\%$ of the TDE population. Direct evidence for outflows in the bulk of the TDE population, discovered through optical, ultraviolet (UV), and X-ray observations, has been lacking. Here we report the discovery of transient radio emission from the nearby optically-discovered TDE ASASSN-14li (distance of 90 Mpc), making it the first normal TDE detected in the radio, and unambiguously pointing to the formation of a non-relativistic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\approx 10^{48}$ erg, a velocity of $\approx 12,000-39,000$ km s$^{-1}$, and a mass of $\approx 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that the outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11-25, in agreement with an independent estimate of the timing of super-Eddington accretion based on the optical, UV, and X-ray observations, and that the ejected mass corresponds to about $1-10\%$ of the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The temporal evolution of the radio emission also uncovers the circumnuclear density profile, $\rho(R)\propto R^{-2.6}$ on a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be probed via direct measurements even in the nearest SMBHs. Our discovery of radio emission from the nearest TDE to date, with a radio luminosity lower than all previous limits, indicates that non-relativistic outflows are ubiquitous in TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys will uncover similar events.},

@article{Allen+2006,
	Abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray observations of nine nearby, X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlation exists between the Bondi accretion rates calculated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles and estimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets. The jet powers, which are inferred from the energies and time-scales required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion rates using a power-law model of the form log(PBondi/1043ergs-1) = A + Blog(Pjet/1043ergs-1), with A = 0.65 +/- 0.16 and B = 0.77 +/- 0.20. Our results show that a significant fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the Bondi accretion radius (2.2+1.0-0.7 per cent, for Pjet = 1043ergs-1) eventually emerges in the relativistic jets. The data also hint that this fraction may rise slightly with increasing jet power. Our results have significant implications for studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. The observed tight correlation suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems, despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas. The similarity of the PBondi and Pjet values argues that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes, where the jets are presumably formed. The tight correlation between PBondi and Pjet also suggests that the accretion flows are approximately stable over time-scales of a few million years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) archival search for blue transients that lie in the magnitude range between "normal" core-collapse and superluminous supernovae (i.e., with -21 <= M  R (peak) <= - 19). Of the six events found after excluding all interacting Type IIn and Ia-CSM supernovae, three (PTF09ge, 09axc, and 09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the center, and a precise offset cannot be determined for two (10nuj and 11glr). All the central events have similar rise times to the He-rich tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich, while PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peak magnitude. All three central events are in low star formation hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our spectrum of the host of PS1-10jh displays similar properties. PTF10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically and spectroscopically from the central events, and its host displays a higher star formation rate. Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nuclei activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three central transients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. We compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruption candidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can be unified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. The accumulated evidence of this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for this class of nuclear transients.},

	Abstract = {Angular momentum loss to circumbinary gas provides a possible mechanism for overcoming the ``last parsec'' problem and allowing the most massive black hole binaries formed from galactic mergers to coalesce. Here we show that if gas disks also catalyze the merger of the somewhat lower mass binaries detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), then there may be a purely gravitational wave signature of the role of gas in the form of a small but finite eccentricity just prior to merger. Numerical simulations suggest that eccentricity, excited by the interaction between the binary and surrounding gas disk, is only partially damped during the final phase of gravitational radiation-driven inspiral. We estimate a typical eccentricity at 1 week prior to coalescence of e\~{}0.01. Higher terminal eccentricities, which can approach e=0.1, are possible if the binary has an extreme mass ratio. The detection of even a small eccentricity prior to merger by LISA provides a possible discriminant 
between gas-driven inspirals and those effected by stellar processes.},

	Abstract = {The existing theory of density wave excitation in two-dimensional gaseous disks by imposed gravitational potentials makes approximations which prevent a direct analytical description of the shifts in effective positions of Lindblad resonances with respect to radii satisfying orbital commensurability requirement, and of the so-called torque cutoff arising at large azimuthal numbers m of the perturbing potential's pattern. Both phenomena are related to the azimuthal forces acting on gas, neglected in the WKB approximation commonly used in the past. We extend previous theories of Lindblad resonance wherever necessary for a consistent analytical treatment of the problem, particularly for large m. Our analytical approach applies to wave excitation at Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating, two-dimensional gas layers (vertically averaged disks or fundamental vertical mode of three-dimensional disks). It explicitly includes the resonance shifts and torque cutoffs. The theory is valid for small 
perturbing potentials of arbitrary form (including highly localized potentials, e.g., point-mass potential, spiral potential with arbitrary pitch angle, etc.). We present a torque formula generalizing the standard Goldreich-Tremaine formula. Especially useful in the problem of disk-satellite interaction, the torque formula provides insight into the origin of the torque cutoff at m larger than the radius to thickness ratio of the disk. Qualitatively, the cutoff is an effect of: (i) a mild (power-law) intrinsic torque cutoff, independent of the radial profile of the imposed potential, and (ii) a sharp (exponential) cutoff due to shifts in effective resonance location away from the perturber. For m → ∞ the latter effect causes the increasingly localized potential to decouple spatially from the wave generation region. A disk annulus surrounding the corotation radius of every m-armed potential, of width comparable with twice the vertical disk scale height, remains evanescent for waves excited by that harmonic 
and does not contribute significantly to the total torque between the perturber and the disk. We discuss the role of gas viscosity, self-gravity, and the applicability of a two-dimensional analysis to Lindblad resonances in three-dimensional disks.},

	Abstract = {Using a generalized torque formula for Lindblad resonances in non-self-gravitating gaseous disks we study the interaction of disks with small, embedded bodies (not able to open a gap). For satellites on circular orbits, the generalized torque formula reproduces exactly the torque cutoff occurring at high azimuthal number m of the potential harmonics, originally found seminumerically by Goldreich \{\&\} Tremaine (1980) in the shearing coordinates representation. The cutoff is attributable to the shift in the effective Lindblad resonance position with respect to the nominal resonant radius given by the usual period commensurabilty requirement. We apply the theory to the problem of orbital eccentricity evolution of embedded satellites. We relax some of the assumptions implicit in previous calculations related to this problem, most importantly that of a spatially smooth perturbing potential. We treat the co-orbital and the external Lindblad resonances within a unified formalism. We calculate the 
total rate of eccentricity damping due to co-orbital resonances and the excitation due to external resonances, the former exceeding the latter by a factor roughly equal to 3, independent of the method of averaging over the vertical disk structure. In application to a solar nebula with embedded planetesimals, the timescales of eccentricity damping for a wide range of planetesimal masses are much shorter than those corresponding to either gas drag, planetesimal growth, or nebular lifetime, and thus relevant to the scenarios of planetary system formation. In application to large (radius > 10 m) particles in Saturn's rings we estimate that the eccentricity is damped on the orbital timescale},

	Abstract = {The mildly nonlinear response of a fluid disk with pressure, viscosity, and self-gravity to spiral stellar forcing is considered as a model of the interstellar medium in spiral galaxies. Nonlinear effects are analyzed through a quasi-linear flow analysis ordered by successive powers of a dimensionless spiral perturbing force, which is the ratio of imposed nonaxisymmetric gravitational to axisymmetric gravitational forces. Waves with mn arms are launched from a position where the wavenumber of a free wave matches n times the wavenumber of the spiral forcing. The launched short wave in the gas is an interarm feature that is more tightly wrapped than the stellar wave. The gas wave extracts energy and angular momentum from the stellar wave, causing it to damp. The application of the results to the stellar disk alone reveals even stronger damping, as stars undergo Landau damping of the short wave. For parameters in M81, damping times are less than 10 exp 9 yr.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the gravitational interaction of a generally eccentric binary star system with circumbinary and circumstellar gaseous disks. The disks are assumed to be coplanar with the binary, geometrically thin, and primarily governed by gas pressure and (turbulent) viscosity but not self-gravity. Both ordinary and eccentric Lindblad resonances are primarily responsible for truncating the disks in binaries with arbitrary eccentricity and nonextreme mass ratio. Starting from a smooth disk configuration, after the gravitational field of the binary truncates the disk on the dynamical timescale, a quasi-equilibrium is achieved, in which the resonant and viscous torques balance each other and any changes in the structure of the disk (e.g., due to global viscous evolution) occur slowly, preserving the average size of the gap. We analytically compute the approximate sizes of disks (or disk gaps) as a function of binary mass ratio and eccentricity in this quasi-equilibrium. Comparing the gap sizes with 
results of direct simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), we obtain a good agreement. As a by-product of the computations, we verify that standard SPH codes can adequately represent the dynamics of disks with moderate viscosity, Reynolds number R approximately 103. For typical viscous disk parameters, and with a denoting the binary semimajor axis, the inner edge location of a circumbinary disk varies from 1.8a to 2.6a with binary eccentricity increasing from 0 to 0.25. For eccentricities 0 less than e less than 0.75, the minimum separation between a component star and the circumbinary disk inner edge is greater than a. Our calculations are relevant, among others, to protobinary stars and the recently discovered T Tau pre-main-sequence binaries. We briefly examine the case of a pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary GW Ori and conclude that circumbinary disk truncation to the size required by one proposed spectroscopic model cannot be due to Linblad resonances, even if the disk is 
nonviscous.},

We report the discovery of an X-ray source, CXOGC J174540.0-290027, coincident with Sgr A* within 0.27"+/-0.18". The probability of a false match is estimated to be <~0.5%.

The observed flux in the 2-10 keV band is ~1.3×10-13 ergs cm-2 s-1, and the absorption-corrected luminosity is ~2.4×1033 ergs s-1. The X-ray emission at the position of Sgr A* is extended, with an intrinsic size of ~1.4" (FWHM), consistent with the Bondi accretion radius for a 2.6×106 Msolar black hole. A compact component within the source flared by up to a factor of 3 over a period of ~1 hr at the start of the observation. The search for Kalpha line emission from iron was inconclusive, yielding an upper limit on the equivalent width of 2.2 keV. Several potential stellar origins for the X-ray emission at Sgr A* are considered, but we conclude that the various properties of the source favor accretion onto the SMBH as the origin for the bulk of the emission. These data are inconsistent with ``standard'' advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) models or Bondi models, unless the accretion rate from stellar winds is much lower than anticipated. The central parsec of the Galaxy contains an ~1.3 keV plasma with electron density ne~26eta-1/2fcm-3, where etaf is the filling factor. This plasma should supply ~10-6 Msolar yr-1 of material to the accretion flow at the Bondi radius, whereas measurements of linear polarization at 150 GHz and above limit the accretion rate near the event horizon to <~10-8 Msolar yr-1, assuming an equipartition magnetic field. Taken together, the X-ray and radio results imply that outflows or convection are playing a role in ADAF models and subequipartition magnetic fields in Bondi models, or else the X-ray emission must be generated predominantly via the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process. The measured extent of the source and the detection of short timescale variability are evidence that the emission from Sgr A* contains both thermal and nonthermal emission components at comparable levels. We also discuss the complex structure of the X-ray emission from the Sgr A radio complex and along the Galactic plane. Morphological evidence is presented that Sgr A* and the H II region Sgr A West lie within the hot plasma in the central cavity of Sgr A East, which we interpret as a supernova remnant that may have passed through the position of the SMBH, leading to a period of increased activity that ended within the past ~300 yr. Similarly, we have discovered bright clumps of X-ray emission located on opposite sides of the Galactic plane, along a line passing through the central parsec of the Galaxy. The arrangement of these lobes suggests that Sgr A* may have experienced an earlier period of increased activity lasting several thousand years during which it expelled hot gas in a bipolar outflow oriented roughly perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Additionally, we present an analysis of stellar emission within the central parsec of the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {In mergers of disk galaxies, gas plays a role quite out of proportion to its relatively modest contribution to the total mass. To study this behavior, we have included gasdynamics in self-consistent simulations of collisions between equal-mass disk galaxies. The large-scale dynamics of bridge- and tail-making, orbit decay, and merging are not much altered by the inclusion of a gaseous component. However, tidal forces during encounters cause otherwise stable disks to develop bars, and the gas in such barred disks, subjected to strong gravitational torques, flows toward the central regions where it may fuel the kiloparsec-scale starbursts seen in some interacting disk systems. Similar torques on the gas during the final stages of a collision yield massive gas concentrations in the cores of merger remnants, which may be plausibly identified with the molecular complexes seen in objects such as NGC 520 and Arp 220. This result appears insensitive to the detailed microphysics of the gas, provided that 
radiative cooling is permitted. The inflowing gas can dramatically alter the stellar morphology of a merger remnant, apparently by deepening the potential well and thereby changing the boundaries between the major orbital families.},

Using data from the literature, the relation between velocity anisotropies and isophote shapes in elliptical galaxies is investigated. It is found that elliptical galaxies most likely can be separated into two classes. Objects having peaked isophotes (indicating weak disk components) are in general consistent with being rotationally flattened, suggesting that these objects are similar to S0 galaxies. In contrast, elliptical galaxies with box-shaped isophotes frequently owe their shape to anisotropies in their velocity dispersion and most likely are triaxial.},

In spherical galaxies, N-body simulations show that binary evolution stalls at separations much too large for significant emission of gravitational waves (the ``final-parsec problem''). Here we follow the long-term evolution of a massive binary in more realistic, triaxial and rotating galaxy models with particle numbers as high as 106. We find that the binary does not stall. The binary hardening rates that we observe are sufficient to allow complete coalescence of binary SBHs in 10 Gyr or less, even in the absence of collisional loss-cone refilling or gasdynamical torques, thus providing a potential solution to the final-parsec problem.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the formation and evolution of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in rotating galactic nuclei, focusing on the role of stellar dynamics. We present the first N-body simulations that follow the evolution of the SMBHs from kiloparsec separations all the way to their final relativistic coalescence, and that can robustly be scaled to real galaxies. The N-body code includes post-Newtonian (P N) corrections to the binary equations of motion up to order 2.5; we show that the evolution of the massive binary is only correctly reproduced if the conservative 1 P N and 2 P N terms are included. The orbital eccentricities of the massive binaries in our simulations are often found to remain large until shortly before coalescence. This directly affects not only their orbital evolution rates, but has important consequences as well for the gravitational waveforms emitted during the relativistic inspiral. We estimate gravitational wave amplitudes when the frequencies fall inside the band of 
the (planned) Laser Interferometer Space Antennae (LISA). We find significant contributions---well above the LISA sensitivity curve---from the higher-order harmonics.},

	Abstract = {We present continued radio observations of the tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 extending to deltat ≈ 216 days after discovery. The data were obtained with the EVLA, AMI Large Array, CARMA, the SMA, and the VLBA+Effelsberg as part of a long-term program to monitor the expansion and energy scale of the relativistic outflow, and to trace the parsec-scale environment around a previously dormant supermassive black hole (SMBH). The new observations reveal a significant change in the radio evolution starting at deltat ≈ 1 month, with a brightening at all frequencies that requires an increase in the energy by about an order of magnitude, and an overall density profile around the SMBH of rhovpropr -3/2 (0.1-1.2 pc) with a significant flattening at r ≈ 0.4-0.6 pc. The increase in energy cannot be explained with continuous injection from an Lvpropt -5/3 tail, which is observed in the X-rays. Instead, we conclude that the relativistic jet was launched with a wide range of Lorentz factors, obeying E(> Gamma j )vpropGamma-2.5  j . The similar ratios of duration to dynamical timescale for Sw 1644+57 and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) suggest that this result may be applicable to GRB jets as well. The radial density profile may be indicative of Bondi accretion, with the inferred flattening at r ~ 0.5 pc in good agreement with the Bondi radius for a ~few × 106 M &sun; black hole. The density at ~0.5 pc is about a factor of 30 times lower than inferred for the Milky Way Galactic Center, potentially due to a smaller number of mass-shedding massive stars. From our latest observations (deltat ≈ 216 days) we find that the jet energy is E  j, iso ≈ 5 × 1053 erg (Ej ≈ 2.4 × 1051 erg for theta j  = 0.1), the radius is r ≈ 1.2 pc, the Lorentz factor is Gamma j  ≈ 2.2, the ambient density is n ≈ 0.2 cm-3, and the projected angular size is r proj ≈ 25 muas, below the resolution of the VLBA+Effelsberg. Assuming no future changes in the observed evolution and a final integrated total energy of Ej ≈ 1052 erg, we predict that the radio emission from Sw 1644+57 should be detectable with the EVLA for several decades and will be resolvable with very long baseline interferometry in a few years.},

	Abstract = {We fit general relativistic, geometrically thin accretion disk models with non-LTE atmospheres to near simultaneous multiwavelength data of 3C\~{}273, extending from the optical to the far ultraviolet. Our model fits show no flux discontinuity associated with a hydrogen Lyman edge, but they do exhibit a spectral break which qualitatively resembles that seen in the data. This break arises from relativistic smearing of Lyman emission edges which are produced locally at tens of gravitational radii in the disk. We discuss the possible effects of metal line blanketing on the model spectra, as well as the substantial Comptonization required to explain the observed soft X-ray excess. Our best fit accretion disk model underpredicts the near ultraviolet emission in this source, and also has an optical spectrum which is too red. We discuss some of the remaining physical uncertainties, and suggest in particular that an extension of our models to the slim disk regime and/or including nonzero magnetic torques 
across the innermost stable circular orbit may help resolve these discrepancies.},

The generation of large scale fields is discussed in terms of an inverse magnetic cascade and the consequences imposed by magnetic helicity conservation are reviewed with particular emphasis on the issue of alpha-quenching.},

	Abstract = {Relativistic jets are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems that contain compact objects. They transport large amounts of energy to large distances from the source and their interaction with the ambient medium has a crucial effect on the evolution of the system. The propagation of the jet is characterized by the formation of a shocked "head" at the front of the jet which dissipates the jet's energy and a cocoon that surrounds the jet and potentially collimates it. We present here a self-consistent, analytic model that follows the evolution of the jet and its cocoon, and describes their interaction. We show that the critical parameter that determines the properties of the jet-cocoon system is the dimensionless ratio between the jet's energy density and the rest-mass energy density of the ambient medium. This parameter, together with the jet's injection angle, also determines whether the jet is collimated by the cocoon or not. The model is applicable to relativistic, unmagnetized jets on all scales and may be used to determine the conditions in active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets as well as in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or microquasars. It shows that AGN and microquasar jets are hydrodynamically collimated due to the interaction with the ambient medium, while GRB jets can be collimated only inside a star and become uncollimated once they break out.},

For black holes in the mass range 10,000 to 10,000,000 solar masses, individual stars penetrating well inside the Roche radius will undergo compression to a short-lived pancake configuration very similar to that produced by a high velocity symmetric collision of the kind likely to occur in the neighborhood of black holes in the higher mass range greater than about 10 to the 9th solar masses. Thermonuclear energy release ensuing in the more extreme events may be sufficient to modify substantially the working of the entire accretion process.},

@article{Cenko+2012,
	Abstract = {We report the discovery by the Swift hard X-ray monitor of the transient source Swift J2058.4+0516 (Sw J2058+05). Our multi-wavelength follow-up campaign uncovered a long-lived (duration >~ months), luminous X-ray (L X, iso ≈ 3 × 1047 erg s-1) and radio (nuL nu, iso ≈ 1042 erg s-1) counterpart. The associated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of 1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust extinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities with the recently discovered GRB 110328A/Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw J1644+57), we suggest that Sw J2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outbursts resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If so, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate of tidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowly collimated (theta < 1$\,^{\circ}$) or only a small fraction of tidal disruptions generate relativistic ejecta. Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the black hole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component. Alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus (AGN)), Sw J2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these sources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with known classes of AGNs capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies).},

	Abstract = {We assemble a statistical set of global mass models for ˜2000 nearly spherical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies at a mean redshift of <z> = 0.12 based on their aperture velocity dispersions and newly derived luminosity profiles in conjunction with published velocity dispersion profiles and empirical properties and relations of galaxy and halo parameters. When two-component (i.e. stellar plus dark) mass models are fitted to the SDSS aperture velocity dispersions, the predicted velocity dispersion profile (VP) slopes within the effective (i.e. projected half-light) radius Reff match well the distribution in observed elliptical galaxies. From a number of input variations the models exhibit for the radial range 0.1Reff < r < Reff a tight correlation <gammae> = (1.865 $\pm$ 0.008) + (-4.93 $\pm$ 0.15)<eta> where <gammae> is the mean slope absolute value of the total mass density and <eta> is the mean slope of the velocity dispersion profile, which leads to a super-isothermal <gammae> = 2.15 $\pm$ 0.04 for <eta> = -0.058 $\pm$ 0.008 in observed elliptical galaxies. Furthermore, the successful two-component models appear to imply a typical slope curvature pattern in the total mass profile because for the observed steep luminosity (stellar mass) profile and the weak lensing inferred halo profile at large radii a total mass profile with monotonically varying slope would require too high dark matter density in the optical region giving rise to too large aperture velocity dispersion and too shallow VP.},

	Abstract = {We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transient PS1-11af, which was also detected by Galaxy Evolution Explorer with coordinated observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an early type galaxy at redshift z = 0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star formation or active galactic nucleus activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of transient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra. Despite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the properties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and the velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in homologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors and slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is consistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to power the observed luminosity is only ~0.002 M &sun;, which points to a partial disruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric luminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a separate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition, the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk models for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature. Three deep non-detections in the radio with the Very Large Array over the first two years after the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflow comparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.},

	Abstract = {We show how the observed AGN radiative output from massive black holes at the centers of elliptical galaxies affects the hot ISM of these systems with the aid of a high-resolution hydrodynamical code, where the cooling and heating functions include photoionization plus Compton heating. Radiative heating is a key factor in the self-regulated coevolution of massive BHs and their host galaxies, and (1) the mass accumulated by the central BH is limited by feedback to the range observed today and (2) relaxation instabilities occur so that duty cycles are small enough (<~0.03) to account for the very small fraction of massive ellipticals observed to be in the ``on'' QSO phase, when the accretion luminosity approaches the Eddington luminosity. The duty cycle of the hot bubbles inflated at the galactic center during major accretion episodes is of the order of >~0.1-0.4. Major accretion episodes caused by cooling flows in the recycled gas produced by normal stellar evolution trigger nuclear starbursts coincident with AGN flaring. Overall, in the bursting phase (1<~z<~3), the duty cycle of the BH in its ``on'' phase is of the order of percents and is unobscured approximately one-third of the time, the obscuration occurring during dusty starbursts. Roughly half of the recycled gas from dying stars is ejected as galactic winds, half is consumed in central starbursts, and less than 1% is accreted onto the central BH. Mechanical energy output from nonrelativistic gas winds integrates to 2.3×1059 ergs, with most of it caused by broad-line AGN outflows. We predict the typical properties of the very metal-rich poststarburst central regions and show that the resulting surface density profiles are well described by S{\'e}rsic profiles.},

	Abstract = {We report Chandra observations of a double X-ray source in the z = 0.1569 galaxy SDSS J171544.05+600835.7. The galaxy was initially identified as a dual active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidate based on the double-peaked [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission lines, with a line-of-sight velocity separation of 350 km s-1, in its Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectrum. We used the Kast Spectrograph at Lick Observatory to obtain two long-slit spectra of the galaxy at two different position angles, which reveal that the two Type 2 AGN emission components have not only a velocity offset, but also a projected spatial offset of 1.9 h -1 70 kpc on the sky. Chandra/ACIS observations of two X-ray sources with the same spatial offset and orientation as the optical emission suggest that the galaxy most likely contains Compton-thick dual AGNs, although the observations could also be explained by AGN jets. Deeper X-ray observations that reveal Fe K lines, if present, would distinguish between the two scenarios. The 
observations of a double X-ray source in SDSS J171544.05+600835.7 are a proof of concept for a new, systematic detection method that selects promising dual AGN candidates from ground-based spectroscopy that exhibits both velocity and spatial offsets in the AGN emission features.},

	Abstract = {Finding electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of future gravitational wave (GW) sources would bring rich scientific benefits. A promising possibility, in the case of the coalescence of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB), is that the prompt emission from merger-induced disturbances in a supersonic circumbinary disc may be detectable. We follow the post-merger evolution of a thin, zero-viscosity circumbinary gas disc with two-dimensional simulations, using the hydrodynamic code FLASH. We analyse perturbations arising from the 530 km s-1 recoil of a 106Msolar binary, oriented in the plane of the disc, assuming either a non-radiative gamma-law or a pseudo-isothermal equation of state for the gas. We find that a single-armed spiral shock wave forms and propagates outwards, sweeping up \~{}40 per cent of the mass of the disc. The morphology and evolution of the perturbations agrees well with those of caustics predicted to occur in a collisionless disc. Assuming that the disc radiates nearly 
instantaneously to maintain a constant temperature, we estimate the amount of dissipation and corresponding post-merger light curve. The luminosity rises steadily on the time-scale of months, and reaches few √\'{o}1043 ergs-1, corresponding to \~{}10 per cent of the Eddington luminosity of the central SMBHB. We also analyse the case in which gravitational wave emission results in a 5 per cent mass loss in the merger remnant. The mass loss reduces the shock overdensities and the overall luminosity of the disc by \~{}15-20 per cent, without any other major effects on the spiral shock pattern.},

	Abstract = {After the destruction of the star during a tidal disruption event (TDE), the cataclysmic encounter between a star and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) of a galaxy, approximately half of the original stellar debris falls back onto the hole at a rate that can initially exceed the Eddington limit by orders of magnitude. We argue that the angular momentum of this matter is too low to allow it to attain a disk-like configuration with accretion proceeding at a mildly super-Eddington rate, the excess energy being carried away by a combination of radiative losses and radially distributed winds. Instead, we propose that the infalling gas traps accretion energy until it inflates into a weakly bound, quasi-spherical structure with gas extending nearly to the poles. We study the structure and evolution of such "zero-Bernoulli accretion" flows as a model for the super-Eddington phase of TDEs. We argue that such flows cannot stop extremely super-Eddington accretion from occurring, and that once the envelope is maximally inflated, any excess accretion energy escapes through the poles in the form of powerful jets. We compare the predictions of our model to Swift J1644+57, the putative super-Eddington TDE, and show that it can qualitatively reproduce some of its observed features. Similar models, including self-gravity, could be applicable to gamma-ray bursts from collapsars and the growth of SMBH seeds inside quasi-stars.},

	Abstract = {We study the efficiency and dynamics of supermassive black hole binary mergers driven by angular momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such binaries form after major galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we investigate the evolution of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of binaries embedded within geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated by disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good agreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e >\~{} 0.35. Accretion on to the black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital frequency. Scaling our results, 
we analytically estimate the maximum rate of binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occurring within the surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 105 <\~{} M <\~{} 108Msolar we find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a \~{} 0.01-0.1pc, in the regime where the disc is optically thick. The minimum merger time-scale is shorter than the Hubble time for M <\~{} 107Msolar. This implies that gas discs could commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole mergers, and that a significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few hundredths of a parsec, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For more massive binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough, we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas disc could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.},

	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations of stellar wind dynamics in the central parsec of the Galactic Centre, studying in particular the accretion of gas on to Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole. Unlike our previous work, here we use state-of-the-art observational data on orbits and wind properties of individual wind-producing stars. Since wind velocities were revised upwards and non-zero eccentricities were considered, our new simulations show fewer clumps of cold gas and no conspicuous disc-like structure. The accretion rate is dominated by a few close `slow-wind stars' (vw <= 750kms-1), and is consistent with the Bondi estimate, but variable on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. This variability is due to the stochastic infall of cold clumps of gas, as in earlier simulations, and to the eccentric orbits of stars. The present models fail to explain the high luminosity of Sgr A* a few hundred years ago implied by Integral observations, but we argue that the accretion of a cold clump with a small impact parameter could have caused it. Finally, we show the possibility of constraining the total mass-loss rate of the `slow-wind stars' using near infrared observations of gas in the central few arcseconds.},

@article{Cuadra+2006,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed discussion of our new 3D numerical models for the accretion of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stellar wind sources on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, we include recently discovered `slow' winds (vw~ 300kms-1), and we account for optically thin radiative cooling. We test our approach by first modelling only one-phase `fast' stellar winds (vw~ 1000kms-1). For stellar wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is of the order of , fluctuates by <~10 per cent, and is in good agreement with previous models. In contrast, decreases by an order of magnitude for wind sources following circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~50 per cent. Then we allow a fraction of stars to produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively after being shocked, forming cold clumps and filaments immersed into the X-ray-emitting gas. We investigate two orbital configurations for the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive to the orbital distribution of the stars. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, producing a quasi-steady `floor' in the accretion rate, of the order of ~3 × 10-6Msolaryr-1, consistent with the values deduced from Chandra observations. The cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful accretion episodes, which may give rise to large-amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time-scales of tens to hundreds of years. The circularization radii for the flows are about 103 and 104 Schwarzschild radii, for the one- and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work. Our work suggests that, averaged over time-scales of hundreds to thousands of years, the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the wind velocities, mass-loss rates and stellar orbits.},

@article{Cuadra+2005,
	Abstract = {Sgr A* is currently being fed by winds from a cluster of gravitationally bound young mass-losing stars. Using observational constraints on the orbits, mass-loss rates and wind velocities of these stars, we numerically model the distribution of gas in the ~ 0.1-10 arcsec region around Sgr A*. We find that radiative cooling of recently discovered slow winds leads to the formation of many cool filaments and blobs, and to a thin and rather light accretion disc on a scale of about an arcsecond. The disc, however, does not extend all the way to our inner boundary. Instead, hot X-ray-emitting gas dominates the inner arcsecond. In our simulations, cool streams of gas frequently enter this region on low angular momentum orbits, and are then disrupted and heated up to the ambient hot gas temperature. The accreting gas around Sgr A* is thus two-phase, with a hot component, observable at X-ray wavelengths, and a cool component, which may be responsible for the majority of the time variability of Sgr A* emission on time-scales of 100-1000 yr. We obtain an accretion rate of a few ×10-6Msolaryr-1, consistent with Chandra estimates, but variable on time-scales even shorter than 100 yr. These results strongly depend on the chosen stellar orbits and wind parameters. Further observational input is thus key to a better modelling of the Sgr A* wind accretion.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we present and analyze a new analytic solution for the saturated (flux-limited) thermal evaporation of a spherical cloud. This work is distinguished from earlier analytic studies by allowing the thermal conductivity to change continuously from a diffusive to a saturated form, in a manner usually employed only in numerical calculations. This closed form solution will be of interest as a computational benchmark. Using our calculated temperature profiles and mass-loss rates, we model the thermal evaporation of such a cloud under typical interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, with some restrictions. We examine the ionization structure of the cloud-ISM interface and evaluate column densities of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and silicon ions toward the cloud. In accord with other investigations, we find that ionization equilibrium is far from satisfied under the assumed conditions. Since the inclusion of saturation effects in the heat flux narrows the thermal interface relative to its classical structure, we also find that saturation effects tend to lower predicted column densities.},

There is evidence that the dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies depend upon their luminosity. In connection with the present investigation, major axis spectra have been obtained. Rotation and velocity dispersion profiles have been derived for four elliptical galaxies NGC 3379, NGC 4839, NGC 4889 and NGC 6909, and for the probable S0 galaxy NGC 584. NGC 3379 is consistent with being a rotationally-flattened isotropic-dispersion constant M/L oblate spheroid. While NGC 584 is classified E/S0, it is most likely an S0. If so, it, along with NGC 128 and NGC 4595, has the most luminous bulges for which kinematical data are available. For NGC 4839 and NGC 4889, two of the three brightest galaxies in Coma, virtually no rotation is found.},

	Abstract = {We examine the consequences of a model in which relativistic jets can be triggered in quiescent massive black holes when a geometrically thick and hot accretion disk forms as a result of the tidal disruption of a star. To estimate the power, thrust, and lifetime of the jet, we use the mass accretion history onto the black hole as calculated by detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the tidal disruption of stars. We go on to determine the states of the interstellar medium in various types of quiescent galactic nuclei, and describe how this external matter can affect jets propagating through it. We use this information, together with a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the structure of the relativistic flow, to study the dynamics of the jet, the propagation of which is regulated by the density stratification of the environment and by its injection history. The breaking of symmetry involved in transitioning from one to two dimensions is crucial and leads to qualitatively new phenomena. At early times, as the jet power increases, the high pressure of the cocoon collimates the jet, increasing its shock velocity as compared to that of spherical models. We show that small velocity gradients, induced near or at the source, steepen into internal shocks and provide a source of free energy for particle acceleration and radiation along the jet's channel. The jets terminate at a working surface where they interact strongly with the surrounding medium through a combination of shock waves and instabilities; a continuous flow of relativistic fluid emanating from the nucleus supplies this region with mass, momentum, and energy. Information about the t -5/3 decrease in power supply propagates within the jet at the internal sound speed. As a result, the internal energy at the jet head continues to accumulate until long after the peak feeding rate is reached. An appreciable time delay is thus expected between peaks in the short-wavelength radiation emanating near the jet's origin and the long-wavelength emission produced at the head of the jet. Many of the observed properties of the Swift 1644+57/GRB 110328A event can be understood as resulting from accretion onto and jets driven by a 106 M &sun; central mass black hole following the disruption of a sun-like star. With the inclusion of a stochastic contribution to the luminosity due to variations in the feeding rate driven by instabilities near the tidal radius, we find that our model can explain the X-ray light curve without invoking a rarely occurring deep encounter. In conjunction with the number density of black holes in the local universe, we hypothesize that the conditions required to produce the Swift event are not anomalous, but are in fact representative of the jet-driven flare population arising from tidal disruptions.},

	Abstract = {We have derived ages, metallicities and enhanced-element ratios [alpha/Fe] for a sample of 83 early-type galaxies essentially in groups, the field or isolated objects. The stellar-population properties derived for each galaxy correspond to the nuclear re/8 aperture extraction. The median age found for Es is 5.8+/-0.6 Gyr and the average metallicity is +0.37+/-0.03 dex. For S0s, the median age is 3.0+/-0.6 Gyr and [Z/H]= 0.53+/-0.04 dex. We compare the distribution of our galaxies in the Hbeta-[MgFe] diagram with Fornax galaxies. Our elliptical galaxies are 3-4 Gyr younger than Es in the Fornax cluster. We find that the galaxies lie in a plane defined by [Z/H]= 0.99 logsigma0- 0.46 log(age) - 1.60, or in linear terms Z ~sigma0× (age) -0.5. More massive (larger sigma0) and older galaxies present, on average, large [alpha/Fe] values, and therefore must have undergone shorter star-formation time-scales. Comparing group against field/isolated galaxies, it is not clear that environment plays an important role in determining their stellar-population history. In particular, our isolated galaxies show ages differing by more than 8 Gyr. Finally we explore our large spectral coverage to derive log(O/H) metallicity from the Halpha and NIIlambda6584 and compare it with model-dependent [Z/H]. We find that the O/H abundances are similar for all galaxies, and we can interpret it as if most chemical evolution has already finished in these galaxies.},

@article{Di-Matteo+2000,
	Abstract = {The discovery of hard X-ray emission from a sample of six nearby elliptical galaxies, including the dominant galaxies of the Virgo, Fornax and Centaurus clusters (M87, NGC 1399 and NGC 4696, respectively), and NGC 4472, 4636 and 4649 in the Virgo cluster, has important implications for the study of quiescent supermassive black holes. We describe how the broad-band spectral energy distributions for these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous haloes at rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by low-radiative-efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of the mass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. The observed suppression of the synchrotron components in the radio band (excluding the case of M87) and the systematically hard X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflow is a natural consequence of systems accreting at low radiative efficiencies. We briefly discuss an alternative model for the observed X-ray emission, in which it is due to non-thermal synchrotron-self-Compton processes in the accretion flows, or outflows. This appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. Emission from a collimated jet viewed off-axis should be distinguishable from the bremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We argue that the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral and elliptical galaxies may arise from the different manner in which interstellar gas is fed into the nuclei. In ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowly cooling) interstellar medium (ISM) is likely to be highly magnetized and have low specific angular momentum, which favours low-radiative-efficiency accretion solutions and, possibly, the formation of the observed jets.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of two massive black holes in a rotationally supported nuclear disc of mass Mdisc = 108Msolar is explored using N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Gas and star particles are copresent in the disc. Described by a Mestel profile, the disc has a vertical support provided by turbulence of the gas, and by stellar velocity dispersion. A primary black hole of mass 4 × 106Msolar is placed at the centre of the disc, while a secondary black hole is set initially on an eccentric corotating orbit in the disc plane. Its mass is in a 1:1, 1:4, and 1:10 ratio, relative to the primary. With this choice, we mimic the dynamics of black hole pairs released in the nuclear region at the end of a gas-rich galaxy merger. It is found that, under the action of dynamical friction, the two black holes form a close binary in \~{}10 Myr. The inspiral process is insensitive to the mass fraction in stars and gas present in the disc and is accompanied by the circularization of the orbit. We detail 
the gaseous mass profile bound to each black hole that can lead to the formation of two small Keplerian discs, weighing \~{}2per cent of the black hole mass, and of size \~{}0.01 pc. The mass of the tightly (loosely) bound particles increases (decreases) with time as the black holes spiral into closer and closer orbits. Double active galactic nucleus activity is expected to occur on an estimated time-scale of <\~{}10 Myr, comparable to the inspiral time-scale. The double nuclear point-like sources that may appear during dynamical evolution will have typical separations of <\~{}10 pc.},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional stellar kinematics of 48 representative elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define a new parameter , which involves luminosity-weighted averages over the full two-dimensional kinematic field as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators, depending on whether they have lambdaR values within their effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. Slow and fast rotators are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. Fast rotators tend to be relatively low-luminosity galaxies with MB >~ -20.5. Slow rotators tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. Three slow rotators of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other slow rotators (besides the atypical case of NGC 4550) contain a large kpc-scale kinematically decoupled core (KDC). All fast rotators (except one galaxy with well-known irregular shells) show well-aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most slow rotators which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. These results are supported by a supplement of 18 additional early-type galaxies observed with SAURON. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that fast and slow rotators are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of fast rotators, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. Detailed numerical simulations in a cosmological context are required to understand how to form large-scale KDCs within slow rotators, and more generally to explain the distribution of lambdaR values within early-type galaxies and the distinction between fast and slow rotators.},

@article{Esquej+2007,
	Abstract = {Context: In recent years, giant amplitude X-ray flares have been observed from a handful of non-active galaxies. The most plausible scenario of these unusual phenomena is tidal disruption of a star by a quiescent supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy.  Aims: Only a small number of these type of events have been observed and confirmed to date. The discovery of more cases would allow a number of fundamental conclusions to be drawn about properties such as the frequency of tidal disruption events, the distribution of quiescent black hole masses and their influence in the context of galaxy/AGN formation and evolution among others.  Methods: Comparing the XMM-Newton Slew Survey Source Catalogue with the ROSAT PSPC All-Sky Survey five galaxies have been detected a factor of up to 88 brighter in XMM-Newton with respect to ROSAT PSPC upper limits and presenting a soft X-ray colour. X-ray luminosities of these sources derived from slew observations have been found in the range 1041{-}1044 erg s-1, fully consistent with the tidal disruption model. This model predicts that during the peak of the outburst, flares reach X-ray luminosities up to 1045 erg s-1, which is close to the Eddington luminosity of the black hole, and afterwards a decay of the flux on a time scale of months to years is expected. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations have been performed on these highly variable objects in order to disentangle their nature and to investigate their dynamical evolution.  Results: Here we present sources coming from the XMM-Newton Slew Survey that could fit in the paradigm of tidal disruption events. X-ray and optical observations revealed that two of these objects are in full agreement with that scenario and three other sources that, showing signs of optical activity, need further investigation within the transient galactic nuclei phenomena.},

	Abstract = {We analyze Hubble Space Telescope surface-brightness profiles of 61 elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges (hereafter "hot" galaxies). The profiles are parameterized by break radius rbetaand break surface brightness 1beta These are combined with central velocity dispersions, total luminosities, rotation velocities, and isophote shapes to explore correlations among central and global properties. Luminous hot galaxies (Mv<-22) have cuspy cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at r≈rbeta to shallow inner profiles I∝r-gamma with gamma<=0.3. Break radii and core luminosities for these objects are approximately proportional to effective radii and total luminosities. Scaling relations are presented for several core parameters as a function of total luminosity. Cores follow a fundamental plane that parallels the global fundamental plane for hot galaxies but is 30% thicker. Some of this extra thickness may be due to the effect of massive black holes (BHs) on central velocity dispersions. Faint hot galaxies (Mv>-20.5) show steep, largely featureless power-law profiles that lack cores. Measured values of rb and b for these galaxies are limits only. At a limiting radius of 10 pc, the centers of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass and luminosity than the cores of large galaxies. At intermediate magnitudes (-22<Mv<-20.5), core and power-law galaxies coexist, and there is a range in rbeta at a given luminosity of at least two orders of magnitude.  Here, central properties correlate strongly with global rotation and shape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law galaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. A search for inner disks was conducted to test a claim in the literature, based on a smaller sample, that power laws originate from edge-on stellar disks. We find only limited evidence for such disks and believe that the difference between core and power-law profiles reflects a real difference in the spatial distribution of the luminous spheroidal component of the galaxy. The dense power-law centers of disky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-rich mergers. The parallel proposition, that cores are the by-products of gas-free stellar mergers, is less compelling for at least two reasons: (1) dissipationless hierarchical clustering does not appear to produce core profiles like those seen; (2) core galaxies accrete small, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in their low-density cores if the satellites survived and sank to the center (whether the satellites survive is still an open question). An alternative model for core formation involves the orbital decay of massive BHs that are accreted in mergers: the decaying BHs may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any exists and scouring out a core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times the stellar mass yields cores in fair agreement with observed cores and is consistent with the energetics of AGNs and the kinematic detection of BHs in nearby galaxies. An unresolved issue is why power-law galaxies also do not have cores if this process operates in all hot galaxies.},

The FLASH code solves the fully compressible, reactive hydrodynamic equations and allows for the use of adaptive mesh refinement. It also contains state-of-the-art modules for the equations of state and thermonuclear reaction networks. The FLASH code was developed to study the problems of nuclear flashes on the surfaces of neutron stars and white dwarfs, as well as in the interior of white dwarfs. We expect, however, that the FLASH code will be useful for solving a wide variety of other problems. This first version of the code has been subjected to a large variety of test cases and is currently being used for production simulations of X-ray bursts, Rayleigh-Taylor and Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities, and thermonuclear flame fronts. The FLASH code is portable and already runs on a wide variety of massively parallel machines, including some of the largest machines now extant.},

@article{Fujita+2014,
	Abstract = {(Abridged) We propose a new method to estimate the Bondi (hot gas) accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of elliptical galaxies. It can be applied even if the Bondi radius is not well-resolved in X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple assumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in nearly a hydrostatic equilibrium in a gravitational potential, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy centre is close to the virial temperature of the galaxy. We apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in nearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest cluster galaxies; BCGs). We find a strong correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets associated with the SMBHs. For most galaxies, the accretion rates are large enough to account for the jet powers. Our results indicate that hot gas in the elliptical galaxies directly controls the feedback from the active galactic nuclei (AGN), which leads to a stable heating of the cluster cool cores. We also find that more massive SMBHs in BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates. This may explain the hyper masses (~10^10 Msun) of some of the SMBHs. Comparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of the AGN suggests that the AGN in the BCGs are extremely radiatively inefficient compared with X-ray binaries in the Milky Way. Lastly, we find a tight correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of cool cores. Their relation is nearly linear and the power generated by the Bondi accretion is large enough to compensate the radiative cooling of the cool cores. The results of this study demonstrate that the AGN feedback associated with Bondi accretion is essential to suppress cooling flows in clusters.},

	Abstract = {We complete the census of nuclear X-ray activity in 100 early-type Virgo galaxies observed by the Chandra X-ray Telescope as part of the AMUSE-Virgo survey, down to a (3sigma) limiting luminosity of 3.7 × 1038 erg s-1 over 0.5-7 keV. The stellar mass distribution of the targeted sample, which is mostly composed of formally "inactive" galaxies, peaks below 1010 M sun, a regime where the very existence of nuclear supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is debated. Out of 100 objects, 32 show a nuclear X-ray source, including 6 hybrid nuclei which also host a massive nuclear cluster as visible from archival Hubble Space Telescope images. After carefully accounting for contamination from nuclear low-mass X-ray binaries based on the shape and normalization of their X-ray luminosity function (XLF), we conclude that between 24% and 34% of the galaxies in our sample host an X-ray active SMBH (at the 95% confidence level). This sets a firm lower limit to the black hole (BH) occupation fraction in nearby bulges within a cluster environment. The differential logarithmic XLF of active SMBHs scales with the X-ray luminosity as L X -0.4$\pm$0.1 up to 1042 erg s-1. At face value, the active fraction---down to our luminosity limit---is found to increase with host stellar mass. However, taking into account selection effects, we find that the average Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity scales with BH mass as M BH ^{-0.62^{+0.13}_{-0.12}}, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.46+0.08 -0.06 dex. This finding can be interpreted as observational evidence for "down-sizing" of BH accretion in local early types, that is, low-mass BHs shine relatively closer to their Eddington limit than higher mass objects. As a consequence, the fraction of active galaxies, defined as those above a fixed X-ray Eddington ratio, decreases with increasing BH mass.},

@article{Gaspari+2015,
	Abstract = {The fueling of black holes is one key problem in the evolution of baryons in the universe. Chaotic cold accretion (CCA) profoundly differs from classic accretion models, as Bondi and thin disc theories. Using 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations, we now probe the impact of rotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the hot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a geometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the black hole accretion rate to ~1/3 of the spherical case value. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure support and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk; the accretion rate is decoupled from the cooling rate, although it is higher than that of the hot mode. In the more common state of a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas velocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor number Tat< 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via thermal instability (TI) and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate up to 100 times the Bondi rate (M* ~ Mcool). Initially, turbulence broadens the angular momentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with prograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold filaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of angular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. As turbulence weakens (Tat > 1), the broadening of the distribution and the efficiency of collisions diminish, damping the accretion rate ∝ Tat-1, until the cold disk drives the dynamics. This is exacerbated by the increased difficulty to grow TI in a rotating halo. The simulated sub-Eddington accretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity observations. CCA predicts inner flat X-ray temperature and r-1 density profiles, as recently discovered in M 87 and NGC 3115. The synthetic Halpha images reproduce the main features of cold gas observations in massive ellipticals, as the line fluxes and the filaments versus disk morphology. Such dichotomy is key for the long-term AGN feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops and boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the rotating disk remains the sole cold structure. Its consumption leaves the atmosphere in hot mode with suppressed accretion and feedback, reloading the cycle.},

@article{Gaspari+2013,
	Abstract = {Bondi theory is often assumed to adequately describe the mode of accretion in astrophysical environments. However, the Bondi flow must be adiabatic, spherically symmetric, steady, unperturbed, with constant boundary conditions. Using 3D adaptive mesh refinement simulations, linking the 50 kpc to the sub-parsec (sub-pc) scales over the course of 40 Myr, we systematically relax the classic assumptions in a typical galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole. In the more realistic scenario, where the hot gas is cooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is boosted up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The cause is the non-linear growth of thermal instabilities, leading to the condensation of cold clouds and filaments when tcool/tff ≲ 10. The clouds decouple from the hot gas, `raining' on to the centre. Subsonic turbulence of just over 100 km s-1 (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal instabilities, even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime turbulent dissipation inhibits their growth (tturb/tcool ≲ 1). When heating restores global thermodynamic balance, the formation of the multiphase medium is violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent collisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy torus promote angular momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On sub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to the very centre via a funnel. In this study, we do not inject a fixed initial angular momentum, though vorticity is later seeded by turbulence. A good approximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which can be used as subgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by cosmological simulations, while accounting for the frequent fluctuations. Since our modelling is fairly general (turbulence/heating due to AGN feedback, galaxy motions, mergers, stellar evolution), chaotic cold accretion may be common in many systems, such as hot galactic haloes, groups and clusters. In this mode, the black hole can quickly react to the state of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated AGN feedback and the symbiotic Magorrian relation. Chaotic accretion can generate high-velocity clouds, likely leading to strong variations in the AGN luminosity, and the deflection or mass-loading of jets. During phases of overheating, the hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion, though strongly suppressed by turbulence. High-resolution data could determine the current mode of accretion: assuming quiescent feedback, the cold mode results in a quasi-flat-temperature core as opposed to the cuspy profile of the hot mode.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new spectral signature for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with circumbinary gas discs: a sharp drop in flux bluewards of the Lyman limit. A prominent edge is produced if the gas dominating the emission in the Lyman continuum region of the spectrum is sufficiently cold (T ≲ 20 000 K) to contain significant neutral hydrogen. Circumbinary discs may be in this regime if the binary torques open a central cavity in the disc and clear most of the hot gas from the inner region, and if any residual UV emission from the individual BHs is either dim or intermittent. We model the vertical structure and spectra of circumbinary discs using the radiative transfer code TLUSTY, and identify the range of BH masses and binary separations producing a Lyman edge. We find that compact supermassive (M ≳ 108 M&sun;) binaries with orbital periods of ˜0.1-10 yr, whose gravitational waves are expected to be detectable by pulsar timing arrays, could have prominent Lyman edges. Such strong spectral edge features are not typically present in AGN spectra and could serve as corroborating evidence for the presence of an SMBHB.},

	Abstract = {The flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star can be used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant and undetected in the centres of distant galaxies. Previous candidate flares have had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two `relativistic' candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet. Here we report a luminous ultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core.},

	Abstract = {The linear response of a differentially rotating two-dimensional gas disk, both with and without self-gravity, to a rigidly rotating external potential is calculated on the assumptions that the speed of sound is much smaller that the orbital velocity and that the external potential varies on the scale of the disk radius. The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found that the external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances, that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the corotation 
resonance. The behavior of particle disks is briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

@article{Goodman2003,
	Abstract = {The outer parts of standard steady-state accretion discs around quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are prone to self-gravity, and they might be expected to fragment into stars rather than feed the central black hole. Possible solutions to this well-known problem are examined with an emphasis on general dynamic constraints. Irradiation by the QSO is insufficient for stability even if the outer disc is strongly warped. Marginal local gravitational instability enhances viscous transport but extends the stable regions only modestly. Compton cooling in the observed QSO radiation field rules out hot thick discs unless the local accretion rate is vastly super-Eddington. The formation of stars or stellar-mass black holes, and the release of energy in these objects by fusion or accretion, may help to stabilize the remaining gas in an otherwise standard disc. But at fixed mass accretion rate, the energy inputs required for stability increase with radius; beyond a parsec, they approach the total QSO luminosity 
and are probably unsustainable by stars. Magnetic torques from a wind or corona, and gravitational torques from bars or global spirals, may increase the accretion speed and reduce the density of the disc. But dynamical arguments suggest that the accretion speed is at most sonic, so that instability still sets in beyond about a parsec. Alternatively, the QSO could be fed by stellar collisions in a very dense stellar cluster, but the velocity dispersion would have to be much higher than observed in nearby galactic nuclei containing quiescent black holes. In view of these difficulties, we suggest that QSO discs do not extend beyond a thousand Schwarzschild radii or so. Then they must be frequently replenished with gas of small specific angular momentum.},

	Abstract = {In large spheroidal stellar systems, such as elliptical galaxies, one invariably finds a 106-109Msolar supermassive black hole at their centre. In contrast, within dwarf elliptical galaxies one predominantly observes a 105-107Msolar nuclear star cluster. To date, few galaxies have been found with both types of nuclei coexisting and even less have had the masses determined for both central components. Here, we identify one dozen galaxies housing nuclear star clusters and supermassive black holes whose masses have been measured. This doubles the known number of such hermaphrodite nuclei - which are expected to be fruitful sources of gravitational radiation. Over the host spheroid (stellar) mass range 108-1011Msolar, we find that a galaxy's nucleus-to-spheroid (baryon) mass ratio is not a constant value but decreases from a few per cent to ~0.3 per cent such that log[(MBH + MNC)/Msph] = -(0.39 +/- 0.07) log[Msph/1010Msolar] - (2.18 +/- 0.07). Once dry merging commences and the nuclear star clusters disappear, this ratio is expected to become a constant value.  As a byproduct of our investigation, we have found that the projected flux from resolved nuclear star clusters is well approximated with S{\'e}rsic functions having a range of indices from ~0.5 to ~3, the latter index describing the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster.},

	Abstract = {To examine the role of the host galaxy structure in fueling nuclear activity, we estimated gas flow rates from several kpc down to the inner few 10 pc for seven nearby spiral galaxies, selected from the NUclei of GAlaxies sample. We calculated gravitational torques from near-infrared images and determined gas in/out-flow rates as a function of radius and location within the galactic disks, based on high angular resolution interferometric observations of molecular (CO using Plateau de Bure interferometer) and atomic (H I using the Very Large Array) gas. The results are compared with kinematic evidence for radial gas flows and the dynamical state of the galaxies (via resonances) derived from several different methods. We show that gravitational torques are very efficient at transporting gas from the outer disk all the way into the galaxies centers at \~{}100 pc; previously assumed dynamical barriers to gas transport, such as the corotation resonance of stellar bars, seem to be overcome by 
gravitational torque induced gas flows from other nonaxisymmetric structures. The resulting rates of gas mass inflow range from 0.01 to 50 M sun yr-1 and are larger for the galaxy center than for the outer disk. Our gas flow maps show the action of nested bars within larger bars for three galaxies. Noncircular streaming motions found in the kinematic maps are larger in the center than in the outer disk and appear to correlate only loosely with the in/out-flow rates as a function of radius. We demonstrate that spiral gas disks are very dynamic systems that undergo strong radial evolution on timescales of a few rotation periods (e.g., 5 × 108 yrs at a radius of 5 kpc), due to the effectiveness of gravitational torques in redistributing the cold galactic gas.},

	Abstract = {We study the number and interaction rates of supermassive black holes in galactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation in which the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. In bright ellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binary black hole is large. Central binaries must therefore merge in less than a Hubble time - otherwise there will be too much scatter in the M*-$\sigma$* relation and too many off-centre galactic nuclei. We propose that binary black holes are able to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger QSO activity in galaxies. If this is the case, less than 10 per cent of faint ellipticals and 40 per cent of bright ellipticals are predicted to harbour binary black holes with near equal masses at their centres. This binary may be ejected away from the centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 per cent of the most luminous ellipticals. The number of low-mass black holes that 
can interact with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxy luminosity. In most faint ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre of the galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminous ellipticals, an average of 10 low-mass black holes interact with the central supermassive object after this time. It is expected that stars will be ejected from galaxy cores as these low mass ratio binaries harden. Multiple black holes in galactic bulges thus provide a natural explanation for the strong systematic trends in the observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a function of luminosity.},

@article{Haiman+2009a,
	Abstract = {Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in galactic nuclei are thought to be a common by-product of major galaxy mergers. We use simple disk models for the circumbinary gas and for the binary-disk interaction to follow the orbital decay of SMBHBs with a range of total masses (M) and mass ratios (q), through physically distinct regions of the disk, until gravitational waves (GWs) take over their evolution. Prior to the GW-driven phase, the viscous decay is generically in the stalled "secondary-dominated" regime. SMBHBs spend a non-negligible fraction of a fiducial time of 107 yr at orbital periods between days lsimt orblsim yr, and we argue that they may be sufficiently common to be detectable, provided they are luminous during these stages. A dedicated optical or X-ray survey could identify coalescing SMBHBs statistically, as a population of periodically variable quasars, whose abundance obeys the scaling N var vprop t $\alpha$ var within a range of periods around t var\~{} tens of weeks. 
SMBHBs with M lsim 107 M sun, with 0.5 lsim $\alpha$ lsim 1.5, would probe the physics of viscous orbital decay, whereas the detection of a population of higher-mass binaries, with $\alpha$ = 8/3, would confirm that their decay is driven by GWs. The lowest-mass SMBHBs (M lsim 105-6 M sun) enter the GW-driven regime at short orbital periods, when they are already in the frequency band of the Laser Interferometric Space Antenna (LISA). While viscous processes are negligible in the last few years of coalescence, they could reduce the amplitude of any unresolved background due to near-stationary LISA sources. We discuss modest constraints on the SMBHB population already available from existing data, and the sensitivity and sky coverage requirements for a detection in future surveys. SMBHBs may also be identified from velocity shifts in their spectra; we discuss the expected abundance of SMBHBs as a function of their orbital velocity.},

	Abstract = {We have tested the two main theoretical models of bubbles around massive star clusters, Castor et al. and Chevalier & Clegg, against observations of the well-studied Carina nebula. The Castor et al. theory overpredicts the X-ray luminosity in the Carina bubble by a factor of 60 and expands too rapidly, by a factor of 4; if the correct radius and age are used, the predicted X-ray luminosity is even larger. In contrast, the Chevalier & Clegg model underpredicts the X-ray luminosity by a factor of 10. We modify the Castor et al. theory to take into account lower stellar wind mass-loss rates, radiation pressure, gravity, and escape of or energy loss from the hot shocked gas. We argue that energy is advected rather than radiated from the bubble. We undertake a parameter study for reduced stellar mass-loss rates and for various leakage rates and are able to find viable models. The X-ray surface brightness in Carina is highest close to the bubble wall, which is consistent with conductive evaporation from cold clouds. The picture that emerges is one in which the hot gas pressure is far below that found by dividing the time-integrated wind luminosity by the bubble volume; rather, the pressure in the hot gas is set by pressure equilibrium with the photoionized gas at T = 104 K. It follows that the shocked stellar winds are not dynamically important in forming the bubbles.},

In the simulations we consider a triple-disk system composing of two accretion disks around BHs and one circumbinary disk surrounding the two. The circumbinary disk works as a mass reservoir. We confirm that a non-axisymmetric accretion disk is formed around each BH. The X-ray luminosity of the secondary BH exhibits the double peaks every binary orbit, whereas that of the primary BH shows a single peak. Such properties can not be seen in the case of equal mass BBHs and therefore provide a potentially important observational signature of supermassive BBHs with low mass ratios.},

	Abstract = {We study accretion processes for tidally disrupted stars approaching supermassive black holes on bound orbits, by performing three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that there is a critical value of the orbital eccentricity below which all the stellar debris remains bound to the black hole. For high but subcritical eccentricities, all the stellar mass is accreted on to the black hole in a finite time, causing a significant deviation from the canonical t-5/3 mass fallback rate. When a star is on a moderately eccentric orbit and its pericentre distance is deeply inside the tidal disruption radius, there can be several orbit crossings of the debris streams due to relativistic precession. This dissipates orbital energy in shocks, allowing for rapid circularization of the debris streams and formation of an accretion disc. The resultant accretion rate greatly exceeds the Eddington rate and differs strongly from the canonical rate of t-5/3. By contrast, there is little dissipation due to orbital crossings for the equivalent simulation with a purely Newtonian potential. This shows that general relativistic precession is crucial for accretion disc formation via circularization of stellar debris from stars on moderately eccentric orbits.},

	Abstract = {We study the circularization of tidally disrupted stars on bound orbits around spinning supermassive black holes by performing three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations with Post-Newtonian corrections. Our simulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the efficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization if radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams self-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the intersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a geometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring rapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a geometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is efficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and forms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated energy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the subsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to ~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find that a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced circularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning black hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably long in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black hole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important nodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the other hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in the radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our simulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar tidal disruptions.},

	Abstract = {Circumbinary disks are considered to exist in a wide variety of astrophysical objects, e.g., young binary stars, protoplanetary systems, and massive binary black hole systems in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, there is no definite evidence for the circumbinary disk except for some in a few young binary star systems. In this Letter, we study possible oscillation modes in circumbinary disks around eccentric and circular binaries. We find that prograde, nonaxisymmetric waves are induced in the inner part of the circumbinary disk by the tidal potential of the binary. Such waves would cause variabilities in emission line profiles from circumbinary disks. Because of prograde precession of the waves, the distance between each component of the binary and the inner edge of the circumbinary disk varies with the beat period between the precession period of the wave and the binary orbital period. As a result, light curves from the circumbinary disks are also expected to vary with the same period. The 
current study thus provides a new method to detect circumbinary disks in various astrophysical systems.},

	Abstract = {We consider accretion flows from circumbinary disks onto supermassive binary black holes on a subparsec scale of the galactic center based on a smoothed particles hydrodynamics (SPH) code. Simulation models are presented for four cases; that is, a circular binary and an eccentric one, each with equal and unequal masses. We find that the circumblack-hole disks are formed around each black hole regardless of the simulation parameters. There are two-step mechanisms that cause accretion flow. First, tidally induced elongation of the circumbinary disk triggers mass inflow toward two closest points on the circumbinary disk. Then, the gas is increasingly accumulated on these two points owing to the gravitational attraction of black holes. Second, when the gas can pass across the maximum loci of the effective binary potential, it starts to overflow via their two points, and freely infalls to each black hole. In circular binaries, the gas continues to be supplied from the circumbinary disk, (i.e., the gap 
between the circumbinary disk and the binary black hole is always closed). In eccentric cases, the mass supply undergoes periodic on/off transitions during one orbital period because of the variation of the periodic potential. The gap starts to close after the apoastron, and to open again after the next periastron passage. Due to the gap closing/opening cycles, the mass-capture rates are eventually strongly phase dependent. This could provide observable diagnosis for the presence of supermassive binary black holes in merged galactic nuclei.},

@article{Heckman+2014,
	Abstract = {We summarize what large surveys of the contemporary Universe have taught us about the physics and phenomenology of the processes that link the formation and evolution of galaxies with their central supermassive black holes. We present a picture in which the population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can be divided into two distinct populations. The radiative-mode AGNs are associated with black holes (BHs) that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ˜1% of the Eddington limit. They are primarily associated with less massive BHs growing in high-density pseudobulges at a rate sufficient to produce the total mass budget in these BHs in ˜10 Gyr. The circumnuclear environment contains high-density cold gas and associated star formation. Major mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback is generic in these objects, and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGNs. In jet-mode AGNs the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets). These AGNs are associated with the more massive BHs in more massive (classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these BHs nor star formation in their host bulge is significant today. These AGNs are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the high-redshift Universe paint a similar picture. Noting that the volume-averaged ratio of star formation to BH growth has remained broadly constant over the past 10 Gyrs, we argue that the processes that linked the cosmic evolution of galaxies and BHs are still at play today.},

	Abstract = {We combine ionized gas ([N II] lambda6583) and stellar central velocity dispersions for a sample of 345 galaxies, with and without active galactic nuclei (AGNs), to study the dynamical state of the nuclear gas and its physical origin. The gas dispersions strongly correlate with the stellar dispersions over the velocity range of sigma ≈ 30-350 km s-1, such that sigma g /sigma* ≈ 0.6-1.4, with an average value of 0.80. These results are independent of Hubble type (for galaxies from E to Sbc), the presence or absence of a bar, or local galaxy environment. For galaxies of type Sc and later and that have sigma* lsim 40 km s-1, the gas seems to have a minimum threshold of sigma g  ≈ 30 km s-1, such that sigma g /sigma* always exceeds 1. Within the sample of AGNs, sigma g /sigma* increases with nuclear luminosity or Eddington ratio, a possible manifestation of AGN feedback associated with accretion disk winds or outflows. This extra source of nongravitational line broadening should be removed when trying to use sigma g  to estimate sigma*. We show that the mass budget of the narrow-line region (NLR) can be accounted for by mass loss from evolved stars. The kinematics of the gas, dominated by random motions, largely reflect the velocity field of the hot gas in the bulge. Lastly, we offer a simple explanation for the correlation between line width and line luminosity observed in the NLR of AGNs.},

	Abstract = {Context: The stellar mass loss rate is important for the rotational evolution of a star and for its interaction with the circumstellar environment. The analysis of astrospheric absorption features enables an empirical determination of mass loss rates of cool stars other than the Sun.  Aims: We develop a model for the wind properties of cool main-sequence stars, which comprises their wind ram pressures, mass fluxes, and terminal wind velocities.  Methods: The wind properties are determined through a polytropic magnetised wind model, assuming power laws for the dependence of the thermal and magnetic wind parameters on the stellar rotation rate. We use the empirical data to constrain theoretical wind scenarios, which are characterised by different rates of increase of the wind temperature, wind density, and magnetic field strength.  Results: Scenarios based on moderate rates of increase yield wind ram pressures in agreement with most empirical constraints, but cannot account for some moderately rotating targets, whose high apparent mass loss rates are inconsistent with observed coronal X-ray and magnetic properties. For fast magnetic rotators, the magneto-centrifugal driving of the outflow can produce terminal wind velocities far in excess of the surface escape velocity. Disregarding this aspect in the analyses of wind ram pressures leads to overestimations of stellar mass loss rates. The predicted mass loss rates of cool main-sequence stars do not exceed about ten times the solar value.  Conclusions: .Our results are in contrast with previous investigations, which found a strong increase of the stellar mass loss rates with the coronal X-ray flux. Owing to the weaker dependence, we expect the impact of stellar winds on planetary atmospheres to be less severe and the detectability of magnetospheric radio emission to be lower then previously suggested. Considering the rotational evolution of a 1 {M&sun;} star, the mass loss rates and the wind ram pressures are highest during the pre-main sequence phase.},

	Abstract = {The interaction between a massive binary and a non-self-gravitating circumbinary accretion disc is considered. The shape of the stationary twisted disc produced by the binary is calculated. It is shown that the inner part of the disc must lie in the binary orbital plane for any value of the viscosity. When the inner disc mid-plane is aligned with the binary orbital plane on the scales of interest and it rotates in the same sense as the binary, the modification to the disc structure and the rate of decay of the binary orbit, assumed circular, caused by tidal exchange of angular momentum with the disc, are calculated. It is shown that the modified disc structure is well described by a self-similar solution of the non-linear diffusion equation governing the evolution of the disc surface density. The calculated time-scale for decay of the binary orbit is always smaller than the `accretion' time-scale t\_acc=m/Msolar (m is the mass of the secondary component, and Msolar is the disc accretion rate), 
and is determined by the ratio of the secondary mass m, assumed to be much smaller than the primary mass, the disc mass inside the initial binary orbit, and the form of viscosity in the disc.},

	Abstract = {We study super-Eddington accretion flows onto black holes using a global three-dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. We solve the time-dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific intensities to accurately calculate the angular distribution of the emitted radiation. Turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability provides self-consistent angular momentum transfer. The simulation reaches inflow equilibrium with an accretion rate ~220 L Edd/c 2 and forms a radiation-driven outflow along the rotation axis. The mechanical energy flux carried by the outflow is ~20% of the radiative energy flux. The total mass flux lost in the outflow is about 29% of the net accretion rate. The radiative luminosity of this flow is ~10 L Edd. This yields a radiative efficiency ~4.5%, which is comparable to the value in a standard thin disk model. In our simulation, vertical advection of radiation caused by magnetic buoyancy transports energy faster than photon diffusion, allowing a significant fraction of the photons to escape from the surface of the disk before being advected into the black hole. We contrast our results with the lower radiative efficiencies inferred in most models, such as the slim disk model, which neglect vertical advection. Our inferred radiative efficiencies also exceed published results from previous global numerical simulations, which did not attribute a significant role to vertical advection. We briefly discuss the implications for the growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe and describe how these results provided a basis for explaining the spectrum and population statistics of ultraluminous X-ray sources.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the observed distribution of Eddington ratios (L/LEdd) as a function of supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with galaxies with significant star formation [M*/starformationrate (SFR) ~ a Hubble time] in their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a broad lognormal distribution of accretion rates peaked at a few per cent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and shows little dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar populations (M*/SFR >> a Hubble time), and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate on to black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the slope of the power law and the decrease in the accretion rate on to black holes in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.},

@article{Kelley+2014,
	Abstract = {The transient Swift J1644+57 is believed to have been produced by an unlucky star wandering too close to a supermassive black hole (BH) leading to a tidal disruption event. This unusual flare displayed highly super-Eddington X-ray emission which likely originated in a relativistic, collimated jet. This presents challenges to modern accretion and jet theory as upper limits of prior BH activity, which we obtain from the radio afterglow of this event, imply that both the pre-disruption BH and stellar magnetic fluxes fall many orders of magnitude short of what is required to power the observed X-ray luminosity. We argue that a pre-existing, `fossil' accretion disc can contain a sufficient reservoir of magnetic flux and that the stellar debris stream is capable of dragging this flux into the BH. To demonstrate this, we perform local, 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the disc-stream interaction and demonstrate that the interface between the two is unstable to mixing. This mixing entrains a sufficient amount of fossil disc magnetic flux into the infalling stellar debris to power the jet. We argue that the interaction with the fossil disc can have a pronounced effect on the structure and dynamics of mass fallback and likely the resulting transient. Finally, we describe possible ramifications of these interactions on unresolved problems in tidal disruption dynamics, in particular, the efficiency of debris circularization, and effects of the disruption on the pre-existing BH system.},

	Abstract = {In spherical galaxies, binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have difficulty reaching sub-parsec separations due to depletion of stars on orbits that intersect the massive binary---the "final parsec problem." Galaxies that form via major mergers are substantially non-spherical, and it has been argued that the centrophilic orbits in triaxial galaxies might provide stars to the massive binary at a high enough rate to avoid stalling. Here we test that idea by carrying out fully self-consistent merger simulations of galaxies containing central SMBHs. We find hardening rates of the massive binaries that are indeed much higher than in spherical models and essentially independent of the number of particles used in the simulations. Binary eccentricities remain high throughout the simulations. Our results constitute a fully stellar-dynamical solution to the final parsec problem and imply a potentially high rate of events for low-frequency gravitational wave detectors like LISA.},

According to hierarchical galaxy merger models, binary black holes should form frequently, and should be common in the cores of galaxies. The presence of massive black hole binaries has been invoked to explain a number of class properties of different types of galaxies, and in triggering various forms of activity. Coalescing massive black hole binaries are powerful emitters of gravitational waves. The search for such binary black holes is therefore of great interest for several topics in astrophysics ranging from galaxy formation to activity in galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Dynamical searches reveal central dark objects with masses \{\$\}\~{}10\^{}6\{\$\}to \{\$\}10\^{}\{9.5\}\{\$\} \msun in the Galaxy, \m31, \mm32, M87, NGC 3115, NGC 3377, NGC 4258, and NGC 4594. Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in \{\$\}\~{}20\backslash\%\{\backslash\$\} of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes 
caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

@article{Krajnovic+2013,
	Abstract = {We investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 ATLAS3D galaxies for which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging is available and compare them to the large-scale kinematics obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph. Specific angular momentum, lambdaR, correlates with the shape of nuclear light profiles, where, as suggested by previous studies, cores are typically found in slow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. As also shown before, cores are found only in massive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass (measured via dynamical models) M ≳ 8 × 1010 M&sun;. Based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution of nuclear slopes. The best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellar velocity dispersion within an effective radius, sigmae, and specific angular momentum, where cores are found for lambdaR ≲ 0.25 and sigmae ≳ 160 km s-1. We estimate that only about 10 per cent of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores. Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators with cores. We also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematically and dynamically different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast rotators, however, could harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, but typically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. Cores of both fast and slow rotators are made of old stars and found in galaxies typically lacking molecular or atomic gas (with a few exceptions). Core-less galaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are underluminous in the diffuse X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we postulate (as many of these galaxies lack HST imaging) a possible population of core-less galaxies among slow rotators, which cannot be explained as face-on discs, but comprise a genuine sub-population of slow rotators. These galaxies are typically less massive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamical cold structures and exponential photometric components. Based on our findings, major non-dissipative (gas-poor) mergers together with black hole binary evolution may not be the only path for formation of cores in early-type galaxies. We discuss possible processes for formation of cores and their subsequent preservation.},

	Abstract = {Unambiguous detection of the tidal disruption of a star would allow an assessment of the presence and masses of supermassive black holes in quiescent galaxies. It would also provide invaluable information on bulge-scale stellar processes (such as two-body relaxation) via the rate at which stars are injected into the tidal sphere of influence of the black holes. This rate, in turn, is essential to predict gravitational radiation emission by compact object inspirals. The signature of a tidal disruption event is thought to be a fallback rate for the stellar debris on to the black hole that decreases as t-5/3. This mass flux is often assumed to yield a luminous signal that decreases in time at the same rate. In this paper, we calculate the monochromatic light curves arising from such an accretion event. Differently from previous studies, we adopt a more realistic description of the fallback rate and of the super-Eddington accretion physics. We also provide simultaneous light curves in optical, ultraviolet (UV) and X-rays. We show that, after a few months, optical and UV light curves scale as t-5/12, and are thus substantially flatter than the t-5/3 behaviour, which is a prerogative of the bolometric light curve, only. At earlier times and for black hole masses <107 M&sun;, the wind emission dominates: after reaching a peak of 1041-1043 erg s-1 at roughly a month, the light curve decreases steeply as ˜t-2.6, until the disc contribution takes over. The X-ray band, instead, is the best place to detect the t-5/3`smoking gun' behaviour, although it is displayed only for roughly a year, before the emission steepens exponentially.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamic simulation of a thin, viscous, locally isothermal corotating disk orbiting an equal-mass Newtonian binary point mass on a fixed circular orbit. We study the structure of the disk after multiple viscous times. The binary maintains a central hole in the viscously relaxed disk with radius equal to about twice the binary semimajor axis. Disk surface density within the hole is reduced by orders of magnitude relative to the density in the disk bulk. The inner truncation of the disk resembles the clearing of a gap in a protoplanetary disk. An initially circular disk becomes elliptical and then eccentric. Disturbances in the disk contain a component that is stationary in the rotating frame in which the binary is at rest; this component is a two-armed spiral density wave. We measure the distribution of the binary torque in the disk and find that the strongest positive torque is exerted inside the central low-density hole. We make connection with the 
linear theory of disk forcing at outer Lindblad resonances (OLRs) and find that the measured torque density distribution is consistent with forcing at the 3:2 (m=2) OLR, well within the central hole. We also measure the time dependence of the rate at which gas accretes across the hole and find quasi-periodic structure. We discuss implications for variability and detection of active galactic nuclei containing a binary massive black hole.},

The overshooting parameter chosen, together with the extent and mass loss rates adopted, generates an MS narrowing for O-stars and a large MS widening for early B-type stars. When compared to other sets of models, the present results allow the identification of several novel observable properties that are sensitive to overshooting for a given mass loss: (1) the mapping of surface C/N and O/N ratios for stars in the upper HR diagram, (2) the mass limits for red supergiants and W-R stars, and (3) the slope of the mass-luminosity relation for W-R stars.},

	Abstract = {We derive the delay-time distribution (DTD) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using a sample of 132 SNe Ia, discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS2) among 66 000 galaxies with spectral-based star formation histories (SFHs). To recover the best-fitting DTD, the SFH of every individual galaxy is compared, using Poisson statistics, to the number of SNe that it hosted (zero or one), based on the method introduced in Maoz et al. This SN sample differs from the SDSS2 SN Ia sample analysed by Brandt et al., using a related, but different, DTD recovery method. Furthermore, we use a simulation-based SN detection-efficiency function, and we apply a number of important corrections to the galaxy SFHs and SN Ia visibility times. The DTD that we find has 4sigma detections in all three of its time bins: prompt (tau < 0.42 Gyr), intermediate (0.42 < tau < 2.4 Gyr) and delayed (tau > 2.4 Gyr), indicating a continuous DTD, and it is among the most accurate and precise among recent DTD reconstructions. The best-fitting power-law form to the recovered DTD is t-1.07 $\pm$ 0.07, consistent with generic ˜t-1 predictions of SN Ia progenitor models based on the gravitational-wave-induced mergers of binary white dwarfs. The time-integrated number of SNe Ia per formed stellar mass is NSN/M = 0.00130 $\pm$ 0.00015  M&sun;-1, or about 4 per cent of the stars formed with initial masses in the 3 - 8 M&sun; range. This is lower than, but largely consistent with, several recent DTD estimates based on SN rates in galaxy clusters and in local-volume galaxies, and is higher than, but consistent with NSN/M estimated by comparing volumetric SN Ia rates to cosmic SFH.},

	Abstract = {Observational work conducted over the past few decades indicates that all massive galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centres. Although the luminosities and brightness fluctuations of quasars in the early Universe suggest that some were powered by black holes with masses greater than 10 billion solar masses, the remnants of these objects have not been found in the nearby Universe. The giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 hosts the hitherto most massive known black hole, which has a mass of 6.3 billion solar masses. Here we report that NGC 3842, the brightest galaxy in a cluster at a distance from Earth of 98 megaparsecs, has a central black hole with a mass of 9.7 billion solar masses, and that a black hole of comparable or greater mass is present in NGC 4889, the brightest galaxy in the Coma cluster (at a distance of 103 megaparsecs). These two black holes are significantly more massive than predicted by linearly extrapolating the widely used correlations between black-hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion or bulge luminosity of the host galaxy. Although these correlations remain useful for predicting black-hole masses in less massive elliptical galaxies, our measurements suggest that different evolutionary processes influence the growth of the largest galaxies and their black holes.},

	Abstract = {New kinematic data and modeling efforts in the past few years have substantially expanded and revised dynamical measurements of black hole masses (M *) at the centers of nearby galaxies. Here we compile an updated sample of 72 black holes and their host galaxies, and present revised scaling relations between M * and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma), V-band luminosity (L), and bulge stellar mass (M bulge), for different galaxy subsamples. Our best-fitting power-law relations for the full galaxy sample are log10(M *) = 8.32 + 5.64log10(sigma/200 km s-1), log10(M *) = 9.23 + 1.11log10(L/1011 L &sun;), and log10(M *) = 8.46 + 1.05log10(M bulge/1011 M &sun;). A log-quadratic fit to the M *-sigma relation with an additional term of beta2 [log10(sigma/200 km s-1)]2 gives beta2 = 1.68 $\pm$ 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in M *. Including 92 additional upper limits on M * does not change the slope of the M *-sigma relation. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the M *-sigma relation but significantly different intercepts---M * in early-type galaxies are about two times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to M *(sigma) give M * that is about two times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our M *-L and M *-M bulge relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations, and core and power-law galaxies yield similar L- and M bulge-based predictions for M *. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in M *, our data set shows weak evidence for increased scatter at M bulge < 1011 M &sun; or LV < 1010.3 L &sun;, while the scatter stays constant for 1011 < M bulge < 1012.3 M &sun; and 1010.3 < LV < 1011.5 L &sun;. A Bayesian analysis indicates that a larger sample of M * measurements would be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with galaxy properties.},

The two black holes will eventually coalesce in an enormous burst of gravitational radiation. Here we show that the orientation of a black hole's spin axis would change dramatically even in a minor merger, leading to a sudden flip in the direction of any associated jet. We identify the winged or X-type radio sources with galaxies in which this has occurred. The inferred coalescence rate is similar to the overall galaxy merger rate, implying that of the order of one merger event per year could be detected by gravitational wave interferometers.},

	Abstract = {In classical loss cone theory, stars are supplied to a central black hole via gravitational scattering onto low angular momentum orbits. Higher feeding rates are possible if the gravitational potential near the black hole is nonaxisymmetric and the orbits are chaotic. Motivated by recently published, self-consistent models, we evaluate rates of stellar capture and disruption in triaxial nuclei. Rates are found to substantially exceed those in collisionally resupplied loss cones, as long as an appreciable fraction of the orbits are centrophilic. The mass captured by a black hole after a given time in a steep ($\rho$\~{}r-2) nucleus scales as $\sigma$5 with $\sigma$ the stellar velocity dispersion, and the accumulated mass in 1010 yr is of the correct order to reproduce the M*-$\sigma$ relation. Triaxiality can solve the ``final parsec problem'' of decaying black hole binaries by increasing the flux of stars into the binary's loss cone.},

The situation arises in galaxies affected by a central bar, in accretion disks in a close binary system, in the disturbance of the asteroid belt by Jupiter, etc. The disk is treated as a continuous network of oscillators, one being in resonance with the satellite. Momentum and continuity equations are defined for the torque and account is taken of the effects of friction and unsteadiness on the torque, and of pressure, viscosity and self-gravitation on waves in disks. Planetary and satellite masses are shown to dominate the magnitude of the torque, while physical processes in the disk affect the torque density at an isolated resonance.},

	Abstract = {We present the first results from AMUSE-Field, a Chandra survey designed to characterize the occurrence and intensity of low-level accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of local early-type field galaxies. This is accomplished by means of a Large Program targeting a distance-limited (<30 Mpc) sample of 103 early types spanning a wide range in stellar masses. We acquired new ACIS-S observations for 61 objects down to a limiting (0.3-10 keV) luminosity of 2.5 × 1038 erg s-1, and we include an additional 42 objects with archival (typically deeper) coverage. A nuclear X-ray source is detected in 52 out of the 103 galaxies. After accounting for potential contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries, we estimate that the fraction of accreting SMBHs within the sample is 45% $\pm$ 7%, which sets a firm lower limit on the occupation fraction within the field. The measured nuclear X-ray luminosities are invariably highly sub-Eddington, with L X/L Edd ratios between ~10-4 and 10-8. As also found in a companion survey targeting Virgo early types, the active fraction increases with increasing host galaxy stellar mass, reflective of "Eddington incompleteness" within the lower-mass objects. For the Field sample, the average nuclear X-ray luminosity scales with the host stellar mass as M 0.71 $\pm$ 0.10 star, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.09 dex. Qualitatively similar results hold for morphologically homogeneous (type E) or uniform sensitivity (new observations only) subsets. A majority of the AMUSE-Field galaxies (78%) inhabit groups, enabling us to investigate the influence of group richness on nuclear activity. We see no evidence for a positive correlation between nuclear X-ray luminosity, normalized to host properties, and galaxy density. Rather, while the scatter is substantial, it appears that the Eddington-scaled X-ray luminosity of group members may be slightly lower than for isolated galaxies, and that this trend continues to cluster early types.},

	Abstract = {Distinct seed formation mechanisms are imprinted upon the fraction of dwarf galaxies currently containing a central supermassive black hole. Seeding by Pop III remnants is expected to produce a higher occupation fraction than is generated with direct gas collapse precursors. Chandra observations of nearby early-type galaxies can directly detect even low-level supermassive black hole activity, and the active fraction immediately provides a firm lower limit to the occupation fraction. Here, we use the volume-limited AMUSE surveys of ~200 optically-selected early-type galaxies to characterize simultaneously, for the first time, the occupation fraction and the scaling of nuclear X-ray luminosity with stellar mass, accounting for intrinsic scatter, measurement uncertainties, and X-ray limits. For early-type galaxies with log(M_star/M_sun)<10, we obtain a lower limit to the occupation fraction of >20% (at 95% confidence), but full occupation cannot be excluded. The preferred dependence of log(L_X) upon log(M_star) has a slope of about 0.7-0.8, consistent with the "downsizing" trend previously identified from the AMUSE dataset, and a uniform Eddington efficiency is disfavored at ~2 sigma. We provide guidelines for the future precision with which these parameters may be refined with larger or more sensitive samples.},

When two galaxies containing massive black holes merge, a binary forms at the center of the new galaxy. We discuss the evolution of the binary after its separation decreases below one parsec. Whether or not stellar dynamical processes can drive the black holes to coalesce depends on the supply of stars that scatter against the binary. We discuss various mechanisms by which this supply can be replenished after the loss cone has been depleted.},

	Abstract = {The long-term evolution of massive black hole binaries at the centers of galaxies is studied in a variety of physical regimes, with the aim of resolving the ``final parsec problem,'' i.e., how black hole binaries manage to shrink to separations at which emission of gravity waves becomes efficient. A binary ejects stars by the gravitational slingshot and carves out a loss cone in the host galaxy. Continued decay of the binary requires a refilling of the loss cone. We show that the standard treatment of loss cone refilling, derived for collisionally relaxed systems like globular clusters, can substantially underestimate the refilling rates in galactic nuclei. We derive expressions for nonequilibrium loss cone dynamics and calculate timescales for the decay of massive black hole binaries following galaxy mergers, obtaining significantly higher decay rates than heretofore. Even in the absence of two-body relaxation, decay of binaries can persist as a result of repeated ejection of stars returning to 
the nucleus on eccentric orbits. We show that this recycling of stars leads to a gradual, approximately logarithmic dependence of the binary binding energy on time. We derive an expression for the loss cone refilling induced by the Brownian motion of a black hole binary. We also show that numerical N-body experiments are not well suited to probe these mechanisms over long times as a result of spurious relaxation.},

	Abstract = {The final merger of a pair of massive black holes in a galactic nucleus is compelled by gravitational radiation. Gravitational waves from the mergers of black holes of masses 105-107(1+z)-1 Msolar at redshifts of 1-20 will be readily detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, but an electromagnetic afterglow would be helpful in pinpointing the source and its redshift. Long before the merger, the binary ``hollows out'' any surrounding gas and shrinks slowly compared to the viscous timescale of a circumbinary disk. The inner gas disk is truncated at the radius where gravitational torque from the binary balances the viscous torque, and accretion onto the black holes is diminished. Initially, the inner truncation radius is able to follow the shrinking binary inward. But eventually the gravitational radiation timescale becomes shorter than the viscous timescale in the disk, leading to a merged black hole surrounded by a hollow disk of gas. We show that the subsequent viscous evolution of 
the hollow, radiation pressure-dominated disk will create an \~{}1043.5(M/106 Msolar) ergs s-1 X-ray source on a timescale \~{}7(1+z)(M/106 Msolar)1.32 yr. This justifies follow-up monitoring of gravitational wave events with next-generation X-ray observatories. Analysis of the detailed light curve of these afterglows will yield new insights into the subtle physics of accretion onto massive black holes.},

	Abstract = {We model the non-thermal transient Swift J1644+57 as resulting from a relativistic jet powered by the accretion of a tidally disrupted star on to a supermassive black hole. Accompanying synchrotron radio emission is produced by the shock interaction between the jet and the dense circumnuclear medium, similar to a gamma-ray burst afterglow. An open mystery, however, is the origin of the late-time radio re-brightening, which occurred well after the peak of the jetted X-ray emission. Here, we systematically explore several proposed explanations for this behaviour by means of multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations coupled to a self-consistent radiative transfer calculation of the synchrotron emission. Our main conclusion is that the radio afterglow of Swift J1644+57 is not naturally explained by a jet with a one-dimensional top-hat angular structure. However, a more complex angular structure comprised of an ultrarelativistic core (Lorentz factor Gamma ˜ 10) surrounded by a slower (Gamma ˜ 2) sheath provides a reasonable fit to the data. Such a geometry could result from the radial structure of the super-Eddington accretion flow or as the result of jet precession. The total kinetic energy of the ejecta that we infer of ˜ few 1053 erg requires a highly efficient jet launching mechanism. Our jet model providing the best fit to the light curve of the on-axis event Swift J1644+57 is used to predict the radio light curves for off-axis viewing angles. Implications for the presence of relativistic jets from tidal disruption events (TDEs) detected via their thermal disc emission, as well as the prospects for detecting orphan TDE afterglows with upcoming wide-field radio surveys and resolving the jet structure with long baseline interferometry, are discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present a new statistical method to determine the relationship between the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the entire cosmic history from z ˜ 4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite galaxies first become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z = 0 to 9 per cent at z =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8 to 1012.5 M&sun;. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at z < 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly. We present convenient fitting functions for stellar masses, star formation rates and accretion rates as functions of halo mass and redshift.},

	Abstract = {We employ hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the low levels of gas and dust in globular clusters. Our models examine the competing effects of mass supply from the evolved stellar population and energy injection from the main sequence stellar members for globular clusters 47 Tucanae, M15, NGC 6440, and NGC 6752. Disregarding all other gas evacuation processes, we find that the energy output from the main sequence stellar population alone is capable of effectively clearing the evolved stellar ejecta and producing intracluster gas densities consistent with current observational constraints. This result distinguishes a viable ubiquitous gas and dust evacuation mechanism for globular clusters. In addition, we extend our analysis to probe the efficiency of pulsar wind feedback in globular clusters. The detection of intracluster ionized gas in cluster 47 Tucanae allows us to place particularly strict limits on pulsar wind thermalization efficiency, which must be extremely low in the cluster's core in order to be in accordance with the observed density constraints.},

	Abstract = {We investigate whether a circumbinary gas disc can coalesce a supermassive black hole binary system in the centre of a galaxy. This is known to be problematic for a prograde disc. We show that in contrast, interaction with a retrograde circumbinary disc is considerably more effective in shrinking the binary because there are no orbital resonances. The binary directly absorbs negative angular momentum from the circumbinary disc by capturing gas into a disc around the secondary black hole, or discs around both holes if the binary mass ratio is close to unity. In many cases the binary orbit becomes eccentric, shortening the pericentre distance as the eccentricity grows. In all cases the binary coalesces once it has absorbed the angular momentum of a gas mass comparable to that of the secondary black hole. Importantly, this conclusion is unaffected even if the gas inflow rate through the disc is formally super-Eddington for either hole. The coalescence time-scale is therefore always ?, where M2 is 
the secondary black hole mass and ? the inflow rate through the circumbinary disc.},

	Abstract = {We consider the interaction between a binary system (e.g. two supermassive black holes or two stars) and an external accretion disc with misaligned angular momentum. This situation occurs in galaxy merger events involving supermassive black holes, and in the formation of stellar--mass binaries in star clusters. We work out the gravitational torque between the binary and disc, and show that their angular momenta J\_b, J\_d stably counteralign if their initial orientation is sufficiently retrograde, specifically if the angle theta between them obeys cos(theta) < -J\_d/2J\_b, on a time short compared with the mass gain time of the central accretor(s). The magnitude J\_b remains unchanged in this process. Counteralignment can promote the rapid merger of supermassive black hole binaries, and possibly the formation of coplanar but retrograde planets around stars in binary systems.},

	Abstract = {The quasi-steady structure of supercritical accretion flows around a black hole is studied based on two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (2D-RHD) simulations. The supercritical flow is composed of two parts: the disk region and the outflow regions above and below the disk. Within the disk region the circular motion and the patchy density structure are observed, which is caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and probably by convection. The mass accretion rate decreases inward, roughly in proportion to the radius, and the remaining part of the disk material leaves the disk to form the outflow because of the strong radiation pressure force. We confirm that photon trapping plays an important role within the disk. Thus, matter can fall onto the black hole at a rate exceeding the Eddington rate. The emission is highly anisotropic and moderately collimated so that the apparent luminosity can exceed the Eddington luminosity by a factor of a few in the face-on view. The mass accretion rate onto the black hole increases with the absorption opacity (metallicity) of the accreting matter. This implies that the black hole tends to grow faster in metal-rich regions, such as in starburst galaxies or star-forming regions.},

@article{Ostriker+2010,
	Abstract = {The deposition of mechanical feedback from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an active galactic nucleus into the surrounding galaxy occurs via broad-line winds which must carry mass and radial momentum as well as energy. The effect can be summarized by the dimensionless parameter eta ={\dot{M}_outf}/{\dot{M}_acc}= {2 ε_wc^2}/{v_w^2} where epsilonw (≡ \dot{E}_w/(\dot{M}_accc^2)) is the efficiency with which accreted matter is turned into wind energy in the disk surrounding the central SMBH. The outflowing mass and momentum are proportional to eta, and many prior treatments have essentially assumed that eta = 0. We perform one- and two-dimensional simulations and find that the growth of the central SMBH is very sensitive to the inclusion of the mass and momentum driving but is insensitive to the assumed mechanical efficiency. For example in representative calculations, the omission of momentum and mass feedback leads to a hundred-fold increase in the mass of the SMBH to over 1010 M sun. When allowance is made for momentum driving, the final SMBH mass is much lower and the wind efficiencies that lead to the most observationally acceptable results are relatively low with epsilonw <~ 10-4.},

	Abstract = {We propose a scenario for launching relativistic jets from rotating black holes, in which small-scale magnetic flux loops, sustained by disc turbulence, are forced to inflate and open by differential rotation between the black hole and the accretion flow. This mechanism does not require a large-scale net magnetic flux in the accreting plasma. Estimates suggest that the process could operate effectively in many systems, and particularly naturally and efficiently when the accretion flow is retrograde. We present the results of general-relativistic force-free electrodynamic simulations demonstrating the time evolution of the black hole's magnetosphere, the cyclic formation of jets, and the effect of magnetic reconnection. The jets are highly variable on time-scales ˜10-103rg/c, where rg is the black hole's gravitational radius. The reconnecting current sheets observed in the simulations may be responsible for the hard X-ray emission from accreting black holes.},

@article{Pellegrini2010a,
	Abstract = {Nuclear hard X-ray luminosities (L X,nuc) for a sample of 112 early-type galaxies within a distance of 67 Mpc are used to investigate their relationship with the central galactic black hole mass M BH (coming from direct dynamical studies or the M BH-sigma relation), the inner galactic structure (using the parameters describing its cuspiness), the hot gas content, and the core radio luminosity. For this sample, L X,nuc ranges from 1038 to 1042 erg s-1, and the Eddington ratio L X,nuc/L Edd from 10-9 to 10-4, with the largest values belonging to four Seyfert galaxies. Together with a trend for L X,nuc to increase on average with the galactic luminosity LB and M BH, there is a wide variation of L X,nuc (and L X,nuc/L Edd), by up to 4 orders of magnitude, at any fixed LB > 6 × 109 L  B,sun or M BH > 107 M sun. This large observed range should reflect a large variation of the mass accretion rate \dot{M}_BH, and possible reasons for this difference are searched for. On the circumnuclear scale, in a scenario where accretion is (quasi) steady, \dot{M}_BH at fixed LB (or M BH) could vary due to differences in the fuel production rate from stellar mass return linked to the inner galactic structure; a trend of L X,nuc with cuspiness is not observed, though, while a tendency for L X,nuc/L Edd to be larger in cuspier galaxies is present. In fact, \dot{M}_BH is predicted to vary with cuspiness by a factor exceeding a few only in hot gas-poor galaxies and for large differences in the core radius; for a subsample with these characteristics the expected effect seems to be present in the observed L X,nuc values. L X,nuc does not show a dependence on the age of the stellar population in the central galactic region, for ages >3 Gyr; less luminous nuclei, though, are found among the youngest galaxies or galaxies with a younger stellar component. On the global galactic scale, L X,nuc shows a trend with the total galactic hot gas cooling rate (L  X,ISM): it is detected both in gas-poor and gas-rich galaxies, and on average increases with L  X,ISM, but again with a large scatter. The observed lack of a tight relationship between L X,nuc and the circumnuclear and total gas content can be explained if accretion is regulated by factors overcoming the importance of fuel availability, as (1) the gas is heated by black hole feedback and \dot{M}_BH varies due to an activity cycle, and (2) the mass effectively accreted by the black hole can be largely reduced with respect to that entering the circumnuclear region, as in radiatively inefficient accretion with winds/outflows. Finally, differently from L X,nuc, the central 5 GHz VLA luminosity shows a clear trend with the inner galactic structure that is similar to that shown by the total soft X-ray emission; therefore, it is suggested that they could both be produced by the hot gas.},

	Abstract = {The expansion of the field equations of general relativity in powers of the gravitational coupling constant yields conservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular momentum. From these, the loss of energy and angular momentum of a system due to the radiation of gravitational waves is found. Two techniques, radiation reaction and flux across a large sphere, are used in these calculations and are shown to be in agreement over a time average. In the nonrelativistic limit, the energy and angular momentum radiation and angular distributions are expressed in terms of time derivatives of the quadrupole tensor Qij. These results are then applied to a bound system of two point masses moving in elliptical orbits. The secular decays of the semimajor axis and eccentricity are found as functions of time, and are integrated to specify the decay by gravitational radiation of such systems as functions of their initial conditions.},

@article{Piran+2015,
	Abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) takes place when a star passes near enough to a massive black hole to be disrupted. About half the star's matter is given elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, the other half is unbound. To "circularize", i.e., to form an accretion flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole's gravitational radius ($\sim 10^{51} (R/1000R_g)^{-1}$~erg). Recent numerical simulations \citep{Shiokawa+2015} have revealed that the circularization scale is close to the scale of the most-bound initial orbits, $\sim 10^3 M_{BH,6.5}^{-2/3} R_g \sim 10^{15} M_{BH,6.5}^{1/3}$~cm from the black hole, and the corresponding circularization energy dissipation rate is $\sim 10^{44} M_{BH,6.5}^{-1/6}$~erg/s. We suggest that the energy liberated during circularization, rather then energy liberated by accretion onto the black hole, powers the observed optical TDE candidates. The observed rise times, luminosities, temperatures, emission radii, and line widths seen in these TDEs \citep[e.g.][]{Arcavi+2014} are all more readily explained in terms of heating associated with circularization than in terms of accretion.},

@article{Preto+2011,
	Abstract = {We investigate a purely stellar dynamical solution to the Final Parsec Problem. Galactic nuclei resulting from major mergers are not spherical, but show some degree of triaxiality. With N-body simulations, we show that equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) hosted by them will continuously interact with stars on centrophilic orbits and will thus inspiral---in much less than a Hubble time---down to separations at which gravitational-wave (GW) emission is strong enough to drive them to coalescence. Such coalescences will be important sources of GWs for future space-borne detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on our results for equal-mass mergers, and given that the hardening rate of unequal-mass binaries is similar, we expect that LISA will see between \~{}10 and \~{} few × 102 such events every year, depending on the particular massive black hole (MBH) seed model as obtained in recent studies of merger trees of galaxy and MBH co-evolution. Orbital 
eccentricities in the LISA band will be clearly distinguishable from zero with e >\~{} 0.001-0.01.},

	Abstract = {Steady accretion disks are considered, and attention is given to the role of viscosity, radiation mechanisms, time dependence, instability, variability, and the inner boundary in the physics of accretion disks. The major uncertainties in accretion disk theory are the dissipation process (viscosity) and the emission process. It is noted that disk modeling is in some sense more an art than a science, and since a steady disk can be constructed for almost any combination of viscosity and radiation processes, the possibilities are almost endless. Conversely, it is likely that more can be learned about the properties of accretion disks in astrophysics by observation and subsequent modeling than by pure theorizing.},

	Abstract = {The radio source Sagittarius A* at the center of our Galaxy is believed to be a 2.6×106 Msolar black hole that accretes gas from the winds of nearby stars. We show that limits on the X-ray and infrared emission from the Galactic center provide an upper limit of ~8×10-5 Msolar yr-1 on the mass accretion rate in Sgr A*. The advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model favors a rate of <~10-5 Msolar yr-1. In comparison, the Bondi accretion rate onto Sgr A*, estimated using the observed spatial distribution of mass-losing stars and assuming noninteracting stellar winds, is ~3×10-5 Msolar yr-1. Thus, there is rough agreement between the Bondi, the ADAF, and the X-ray-inferred accretion rates for Sgr A*. We discuss uncertainties in these estimates, emphasizing the importance of upcoming observations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory for tightening the X-ray-derived limits.},

They are used to study the evolution of binaries in simple models for galactic nuclei, starting soon after the black holes become bound and continuing until the evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational radiation or until the ejected mass is too large for the galaxy to be considered fixed. The eccentricity growth is found to be unimportant unless the binary forms with a large eccentricity. The scattering results suggest that a binary with masses m\_1>=m\_2 should not be considered hard until its orbital velocity exceeds the background velocity dispersion by a factor that scales as (1+m\_1/m\_2)\^{}1/2. The results are compared with predictions from Chandrasekhar's dynamical-friction formula and with previous work on the capture and scattering of comets by planetary systems.},

	Abstract = {We study the dynamics of supermassive black hole binaries embedded in circumbinary gaseous discs, with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. The subparsec binary (of total mass M and mass ratio q= 1/3) has excavated a gap and transfers its angular momentum to the self-gravitating disc (Mdisc= 0.2M). We explore the changes of the binary eccentricity, e, by simulating a sequence of binary models that differ in the initial eccentricity e0 only. In initially low-eccentric binaries, the eccentricity increases with time, while in high-eccentric binaries e declines, indicating the existence of a limiting eccentricity ecrit that is found to fall in the interval [0.6, 0.8]. We also present an analytical interpretation for this saturation limit. An important consequence of the existence of ecrit is the detectability of a significant residual eccentricity eLISA by the proposed gravitational wave detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It is found that at the moment of entering the 
LISA frequency domain eLISA� 10-3-10-2, a signature of its earlier coupling with the massive circumbinary disc. We also observe large periodic inflows across the gap, occurring on the binary and disc dynamical time-scales rather than on the viscous time. These periodic changes in the accretion rate (with amplitudes up to �100 per cent, depending on the binary eccentricity) can be considered a fingerprint of eccentric subparsec binaries migrating inside a circumbinary disc.},

	Abstract = {We outline the eccentricity evolution of sub-parsec massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) forming in galaxy mergers. In both stellar and gaseous environments, MBHBs are expected to grow large orbital eccentricities before they enter the gravitational wave (GW) observational domain. We re--visit the predicted eccentricities detectable by space based laser interferometers (as the proposed ELISA/NGO) for both environments. Close to coalescence, many MBHBs will still maintain detectable eccentricities, spanning a broad range from <10\^{}\{-5\} up to <\~{} 0.5. Stellar and gas driven dynamics lead to distinct distributions, with the latter favoring larger eccentricities. At larger binary separations, when emitted GWs will be observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), the expected eccentricities are usually quite large, in the range 0.01-0.7, which poses an important issue for signal modelling and detection algorithms. In this window, large eccentricities also have implications on proposed electromagnetic 
counterparts to the GW signal, which we briefly review.},

More than 10 radio components have been detected moving away from the nucleus with different superluminal speeds and position angles. The pattern of ejection suggests the existence of a precessing inner jet, whose kinematics has been discussed by Abraham \{\&\} Romero (1999). We now present a binary black hole model for the central engine of 3C 273 where the rapid precession is tidally induced in the primary accretion disk inner region by a secondary black hole in a non-coplanar orbit. Using $\gamma$- and X-ray data we estimate upper limits for the mass of the primary, and then we compute the relevant parameters of the system for a variety of disk models. We also discuss some of the implications of the model for the electromagnetic and gravitational radiation from 3C 273.},

(1992). The period and amplitude of the wiggles can be explained as due to the orbital motion of a binary black hole with mass of order l0 exp 8 solar masses, mass ratio larger than 0.1, and orbital radius about 10 exp 16 cm. The jet's inclination to the line of sight should be small confirming the standard interpretation of superluminal motion and one-sidedness as due to relativistic motion in a direction close to the line of sight. The small orbital radius suggests that the binary has been losing a significant amount of orbital energy during the last 10 exp 7 yr, possibly by interaction with the matter which is flowing through the active galactic nucleus. The arcsec-scale radio structure provides additional support for a link between activity and binary evolution. If our interpretation of the mass 
wiggle in this quasar is correct, then many other quasars may contain massive binary black holes as well.},

	Abstract = {We examine unresolved nuclear X-ray sources in 57 brightest cluster galaxies to study the relationship between nuclear X-ray emission and accretion on to supermassive black holes. The majority of the clusters in our sample have prominent X-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres, which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate on to the supermassive black holes over the past several hundred Myr. We find that roughly half of the sample have detectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated with average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing accretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts, in the last ˜107 yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear X-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as the mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet power when the mean accretion rate rises above a few per cent of the Eddington rate, or a power output of {˜ }10^{45} {erg s^{-1}}, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on time-scales of 6 months to 10 years. If variability at this level is a common phenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship between mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity. We find no significant change in the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable objects. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is consistent with emission from either a jet, an advection-dominated accretion flow, or a combination of the two, although other origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gas or nearly spherical inflows of hot keV gas. For a subset of 13 nearby systems in our sample, we re-examine the relationship between the jet power and the Bondi accretion rate. The results indicate weaker evidence for a trend between Bondi accretion and jet power, due to uncertainties in the cavity volumes and gas densities at the Bondi radius. We suggest that cold gas fuelling could be a likely source of accretion power in these objects; however, we cannot rule out Bondi accretion, which could play a significant role in low-power jets.},

	Abstract = {A new general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamical code KORAL is described, which employs the M1 scheme to close the radiation moment equations. The code has been successfully verified against a number of tests. Axisymmetric simulations of super-critical magnetized accretion on non-rotating (a* = 0.0) and spinning (a* = 0.9) black holes are presented. The accretion rates in the two models are dot{M}≈ 100-200 dot{M}_Edd. These first general relativistic simulations of super-critical black hole accretion are potentially relevant to tidal disruption events and hyper-accreting supermassive black holes in the early Universe. Both simulated models are optically and geometrically thick, and have funnels through which energy escapes in the form of relativistic gas, Poynting flux and radiative flux. The jet is significantly more powerful in the a* = 0.9 run. The net energy outflow rate in the two runs correspond to efficiencies of 5 per cent (a* = 0) and 33 per cent (a* = 0.9), as measured with respect to the mass accretion rate at the black hole. These efficiencies agree well with those measured in previous simulations of non-radiative geometrically thick discs. Furthermore, in the a* = 0.9 run, the outflow power appears to originate in the spinning black hole, suggesting that the associated physics is again similar in non-radiative and super-critical accretion flows. While the two simulations are efficient in terms of total energy outflow, both runs are radiatively inefficient. Their luminosities are only ˜1-10LEdd, which corresponds to a radiative efficiency ˜0.1 per cent. Interestingly, most of the radiative luminosity emerges through the funnels where the local radiative flux is highly super-Eddington.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the importance of feedback via photoionization and Compton heating on the co-evolution of massive black holes (MBHs) at the centre of spheroidal galaxies, and their stellar and gaseous components. We first assess the energetics of the radiative feedback from a typical quasar on the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). We then demonstrate that the observed MBH-sigma relation could be established following the conversion of most of the gas of an elliptical progenitor into stars, specifically when the gas-to-stars mass ratio in the central regions has dropped to a low level ~0.01 or less, so that gas cooling is no longer able to keep up with the radiative heating by the growing central massive black hole (MBH). A considerable amount of the remaining gas will be expelled and both MBH accretion and star formation will proceed at significantly reduced rates thereafter, in agreement with observations of present-day ellipticals. We find further support for this scenario by evolving over an equivalent Hubble time a simple, physically based toy model that additionally takes into account the mass and energy return for the spheroid evolving stellar population, a physical ingredient often neglected in similar approaches.},

	Abstract = {We present a new semiempirical relation for the mass loss of cool stellar winds, which so far has frequently been described by ``Reimers' law.'' Originally, this relation was based solely on dimensional scaling arguments without any physical interpretation. In our approach, the wind is assumed to result from the spillover of the extended chromosphere, possibly associated with the action of waves, especially Alfv{\'e}n waves, which are used as guidance in the derivation of the new formula. We obtain a relation akin to the original Reimers law, but which includes two new factors. They reflect how the chromospheric height depends on gravity and how the mechanical energy flux depends, mainly, on the effective temperature. The new relation is tested and sensitively calibrated by modeling the blue end of the horizontal branch of globular clusters. The most significant difference from mass-loss rates predicted by the Reimers relation is an increase by up to a factor of 3 for luminous late-type (super)giants, in good agreement with observations.},

The nearly monochromatic gravitational waves emitted by the decaying orbit of an ultra?compact, two?neutron?star binary system just before the stars coalesce are very likely to be detected by the kilometre?sized interferometric gravitational wave antennas now being designed1?4. The signal is easily identified and contains enough information to determine the absolute distance to the binary, independently of any assumptions about the masses of the stars. Ten events out to 100 Mpc may suffice to measure the Hubble constant to 3\% accuracy.},

	Abstract = {Tidal torques from a binary black hole empty out the central regions in any circumbinary gaseous accretion disk. The balance between tidal torques and viscosity maintain the inner edge of the disk at a radius \{\&\}rtilde;1.5a-2a, where a is the binary semimajor axis. Eventually, the inspiraling binary decouples from the disk and merges, leaving behind a central hollow (``donut hole'') in the disk orbiting the remnant black hole. We present a simple, time-dependent, Newtonian calculation that follows the secular (viscous) evolution of the disk as it fills up the hollow down to the black hole innermost stable circular orbit and then relaxes to stationary equilibrium. We use our model to calculate the electromagnetic radiation (``afterglow'') spectrum emitted during this transient accretion epoch. Observing the temporal increase in the total electromagnetic flux and the hardening of the spectrum as the donut hole fills may help confirm a binary black hole merger detected by a gravitational wave 
interferometer. We show how the very existence of the initial hollow can lead to super-Eddington accretion during this secular phase if the rate is not very far below Eddington prior to decoupling. Our model, though highly idealized, may be useful in establishing some of the key parameters, thermal emission features and scalings that characterize this transient. It can serve as a guide in the design and calibration of future radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity.},

	Abstract = {Based on the dynamical black hole (BH) mass estimates, NGC 3115 hosts the closest billion solar mass BH. Deep studies of the center revealed a very underluminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) immersed in an old massive nuclear star cluster. Recent 1 Ms Chandra X-ray visionary project observations of the NGC 3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous gas, which fuels the AGN. In this paper we connect the processes in the nuclear star cluster with the feeding of the supermassive BH. We model the hot gas flow sustained by the injection of matter and energy from the stars and supernova explosions. We incorporate electron heat conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, the gravitational pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and Coulomb collisions. Fitting simulated X-ray emission to the spatially and spectrally resolved observed data, we find the best-fitting solutions with chi2/dof = 1.00 for dof = 236 both with and without conduction. The radial modeling favors a low BH mass <1.3 × 109 M &sun;. The best-fitting supernova rate and the best-fitting mass injection rate are consistent with their expected values. The stagnation point is at r st <~ 1'', so that most of the gas, including the gas at a Bondi radius rB = 2''-4'', outflows from the region. We put an upper limit on the accretion rate at 2 × 10-3 M &sun; yr-1. We find a shallow density profile nvpropr -beta with beta ≈ 1 over a large dynamic range. This density profile is determined in the feeding region 0.''5-10'' as an interplay of four processes and effects: (1) the radius-dependent mass injection, (2) the effect of the galactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion flow onset at r <~ 1'', and (4) the outflow at r >~ 1''. The gas temperature is close to the virial temperature Tv at any radius.},

	Abstract = {We study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive black hole tidally disrupts a star joins an accretion flow. Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of the tidal debris motion, we track such a system until ~80% of the stellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most tightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the characteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound material, not the tidal radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are caused by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during its disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion flow is non-monotonic and slow, requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of the most tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by shocks does, however, remove enough angular momentum and energy from some mass for it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the accretion rate rises sharply and then decays roughly as a power-law, its maximum is ~0.1x the previous expectation, and the duration of the peak is ~5x longer than previously predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event timescale is therefore ~0.2x the value given by classical theory.},

@article{Springel+2005b,
	Abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs 
markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r\~{}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {With a goal of searching for accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we report the results of ultra-deep Jansky Very Large Array radio continuum observations of the cores of three Galactic globular clusters: M15, M19, and M22. We reach rms noise levels of 1.5-2.1 muJy beam-1 at an average frequency of 6 GHz. No sources are observed at the center of any of the clusters. For a conservative set of assumptions about the properties of the accretion, we set 3sigma upper limits on IMBHs from 360 to 980 M &sun;. These limits are among the most stringent obtained for any globular cluster. They add to a growing body of work that suggests either (1) IMBHs >~ 1000 M &sun; are rare in globular clusters or (2) when present, IMBHs accrete in an extraordinarily inefficient manner.},

	Abstract = {During the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by a massive black hole (BH) having mass MBH≲ 107 M&sun;, the stellar debris is expected to fall back to the BH at a rate well above the Eddington rate. Some fraction of this gas is predicted to be blown away from the BH, producing an optically bright flare of radiation. We predict the spectra and spectral evolution of tidal disruption events, focusing on the signatures produced by photoionized gas outside the photosphere of this super-Eddington outflow. We show that the spectrum of such an outflow should show absorption lines that are strongly blueshifted relative to the host galaxy, are typically very broad (0.01-0.1c) and are most prominent at ultraviolet wavelengths (e.g. C IV, Lyman alpha, O VI) at early times (≲1 month for a ˜106 M&sun; BH). There may also be optical absorption lines of hydrogen and He II if there is a lower velocity component to the outflow (≲0.01c). At later times, the outflow falls out of thermal equilibrium and the continuum emission likely hardens - the absorption lines will then primarily be in the soft X-rays.  Supernovae in galactic nuclei are a significant source of confusion in optical surveys for tidal disruption events: we estimate that nuclear Type Ia supernovae are two orders of magnitude more common than tidal disruption events at z˜ 0.1 for ground-based surveys. Nuclear Type II supernovae occur at a comparable rate but can be excluded by pre-selecting red galaxies. The contamination from nuclear supernovae can be reduced to a manageable level by using high-resolution follow-up imaging with adaptive optics or the Hubble Space Telescope. Our predictions should help optical transient surveys capitalize on their potential for discovering tidal disruption events.},

@article{Strubbe&Quataert2009,
	Abstract = {A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole (BH) is shredded by the BH's tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the BH at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a flare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal flares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ~10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the BH via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for BHs with MBH ~ 105-106Msolar and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outflows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will significantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass BHs and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive BHs.},

@article{Tchekhovskoy+2014,
	Abstract = {The unusual transient Swift J1644+57 likely resulted from a collimated relativistic jet, powered by the sudden onset of accretion on to a massive black hole (BH) following the tidal disruption (TD) of a star. However, several mysteries cloud the interpretation of this event, including (1) the extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray light curve during the first t - ttrig ˜ 10 d after the gamma-ray trigger; (2) unexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission at t - ttrig ˜ months; (3) lack of obvious evidence for jet precession, despite the misalignment typically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disc and BH; (4) recent abrupt shut-off in the jet X-ray emission at t - ttrig ˜ 1.5 yr. Here, we show that all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one assumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi* threading the BH. Just after the TD event, Phi* is dynamically weak relative to the high rate of fall-back accretion dot{M}, such that the accretion disc (jet) freely precesses about the BH axis = our line of sight. As dot{M} decreases, however, Phi* becomes dynamically important, leading to a state of `magnetically arrested disk' (MAD). MAD naturally aligns the jet with the BH spin, but only after an extended phase of violent rearrangement (jet wobbling), which in Swift J1644+57 starts a few days before the gamma-ray trigger and explains the erratic early light curve. Indeed, the entire X-ray light curve can be fitted to the predicted power-law decay dot{M} ∝ t^{-alpha } (alpha ~= 5/3 - 2.2) if the TD occurred a few weeks prior to the gamma-ray trigger. Jet energy directed away from the line of sight, either prior to the trigger or during the jet alignment process, eventually manifests as the observed radio rebrightening, similar to an off-axis (orphan) gamma-ray burst afterglow. As suggested recently, the late X-ray shut-off occurs when the disc transitions to a geometrically thin (jetless) state once dot{M} drops below ˜the Eddington rate. We predict that, in several years, a transition to a low/hard state will mark a revival of the jet and its associated X-ray emission. We use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain the properties of the BH and disrupted star, finding that a solar mass main-sequence star disrupted by a relatively low-mass M* ˜ 105-106 M&sun; BH is consistent with the data, while a white dwarf disruption (though still possible) is disfavoured. The magnetic flux required to power Swift J1644+57 is much too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it could be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disc that was present in the galactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disc could be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful jets.},

@article{Thomas+2005,
	Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to set constraints on the epochs of early-type galaxy formation through the ``archaeology'' of the stellar populations in local galaxies. Using our models of absorption-line indices that account for variable abundance ratios, we derive ages, total metallicities, and element ratios of 124 early-type galaxies in high- and low-density environments. The data are analyzed by comparison with mock galaxy samples created through Monte Carlo simulations taking the typical average observational errors into account, in order to eliminate artifacts caused by correlated errors. We find that all three parameters, age, metallicity, and alpha/Fe ratio, are correlated with velocity dispersion. We show that these results are robust against recent revisions of the local abundance pattern at high metallicities. To recover the observed scatter we need to assume an intrinsic scatter of about 20% in age, 0.08 dex in [Z/H], and 0.05 dex in [alpha/Fe]. All low-mass objects with M*<~1010Msolar (sigma<~130km s-1) show evidence for the presence of intermediate-age stellar populations with low alpha/Fe ratios. About 20% of the intermediate-mass objects with 1010<~M*/Msolar<~1011 [110<~sigma/(kms-1)<~230 both elliptical and lenticular galaxies] must have either a young subpopulation or a blue horizontal branch. On the basis of the above relationships, valid for the bulk of the sample, we show that the Mg-sigma relation is mainly driven by metallicity, with similar contributions from the alpha/Fe ratio (23%) and age (17%). We further find evidence for an influence of the environment on the stellar population properties. Massive early-type galaxies in low-density environments seem on average ~2 Gyr younger and slightly (~0.05-0.1 dex) more metal-rich than their counterparts in high-density environments. No offsets in the alpha/Fe ratios are instead detected. With the aid of a simple chemical evolution model, we translate the derived ages and alpha/Fe ratios into star formation histories. We show that most star formation activity in early-type galaxies is expected to have happened between redshifts ~3 and 5 in high-density environments and between redshifts 1 and 2 in low-density environments. We conclude that at least 50% of the total stellar mass density must have already formed at z~1, in good agreement with observational estimates of the total stellar mass density as a function of redshift. Our results suggest that significant mass growth in the early-type galaxy population below z~1 must be restricted to less massive objects, and a significant increase of the stellar mass density between redshifts 1 and 2 should be present, caused mainly by the field galaxy population. The results of this paper further imply the presence of vigorous star formation episodes in massive objects at z~2-5 and evolved elliptical galaxies around z~1, both observationally identified as SCUBA galaxies and extremely red objects, respectively.},

@article{Thorne+1976,
	Abstract = {It is argued that the collapse which forms the supermassive black holes that are likely to exist in the nuclei of many quasars and galaxies, and collisions between those holes, should produce strong broadband bursts of gravitational waves. The mean time between such gravitational-wave bursts at earth is analyzed in terms of the present Hubble expansion rate, the present deceleration parameter of the universe, the redshift z = 2.5 (at which most of the bursts are assumed to have been generated), the present number density of 'centers' where the bursts originated, the mean number of bursts generated in each center during its active life, and the speed of light. The analysis shows that the range from one week to 300 years is reasonable for the time between bursts, although it is admitted that hardly any bursts at all is also reasonable. Expected characteristics of the bursts are deduced, and it is shown that the best detector for these bursts will probably be Doppler tracking of one or more 
interplanetary spacecraft.},

@article{van-Dokkum+2014,
	Abstract = {We introduce a new method to determine the relative contributions of different types of stars to the integrated light of nearby early-type galaxies. As is well known, the surface brightness of these galaxies shows pixel-to-pixel fluctuations due to Poisson variations in the number of giant stars. Differential spectroscopy of pixels as a function of fluctuation strength ("fluctuation spectroscopy") effectively measures the spectral variation of stars as a function of their luminosity, information that is otherwise difficult to obtain for individual stars outside of the Local Group. We apply this technique to the elliptical galaxy NGC 4472, using HST/ACS imaging in six narrow-band ramp filters tuned to spectral features in the range 0.8-1.0 micron. Pixels with +- 5% broad-band variations show differential color variations of 0.1% - 1.0% in the narrow-band filters. These variations are primarily due to the systematic increase in TiO absorption strength with increasing luminosity on the upper giant branch. The data are very well reproduced by the same Conroy & van Dokkum (2012) stellar population synthesis model that is the best fit to the integrated light, with residuals in the range 0.03% - 0.09%. Models with ages or metallicities that are significantly different from the integrated-light values do not yield good fits. We can also rule out several modifications to the underlying model, including the presence of a significant (>3% of the light) population of late M giants. The current observations constitute a powerful test of the expected luminosities and temperatures of metal-rich giants in massive early-type galaxies. Studies of pixels with much larger (negative) fluctuations will provide unique information on main sequence stars and the stellar initial mass function.},

	Abstract = {Using archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multi-epoch imaging data (Stripe 82), we have searched for the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in non-active galaxies. Two candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) are identified. The TDE flares have optical blackbody temperatures of 2 × 104 K and observed peak luminosities of Mg = -18.3 and -20.4 (nuL nu = 5 × 1042, 4 × 1043 erg s-1, in the rest frame); their cooling rates are very low, qualitatively consistent with expectations for tidal disruption flares. The properties of the TDE candidates are examined using (1) SDSS imaging to compare them to other flares observed in the search, (2) UV emission measured by GALEX, and (3) spectra of the hosts and of one of the flares. Our pipeline excludes optically identifiable AGN hosts, and our variability monitoring over nine years provides strong evidence that these are not flares in hidden AGNs. The spectra and color evolution of the flares are unlike any SN observed to date, their strong late-time UV emission is particularly distinctive, and they are nuclear at high resolution arguing against these being first cases of a previously unobserved class of SNe or more extreme examples of known SN types. Taken together, the observed properties are difficult to reconcile with an SN or an AGN-flare explanation, although an entirely new process specific to the inner few hundred parsecs of non-active galaxies cannot be excluded. Based on our observed rate, we infer that hundreds or thousands of TDEs will be present in current and next-generation optical synoptic surveys. Using the approach outlined here, a TDE candidate sample with O(1) purity can be selected using geometric resolution and host and flare color alone, demonstrating that a campaign to create a large sample of TDEs, with immediate and detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, is feasible. A by-product of this work is quantification of the power spectrum of extreme flares in AGNs.},

@article{van-Velzen+2013a,
	Abstract = {Context. Many decades of observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries have shown that relativistic jets are ubiquitous when compact objects accrete. One could therefore anticipate the launch of a jet after a star is disrupted and accreted by a massive black hole. This birth of a relativistic jet may have been observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which were discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has been detected from the tens of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical to soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up at radio frequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting, which reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing follow-up observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery, the non-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect to the time of disruption.  Aims: We wish to test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets.  Methods: We present 5 GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs, a significant increase of the number of radio observations of these events. To avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since the estimated time of disruption.  Results: None of the sources are detected, with very deep upper limits at the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out the hypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars. We also constrain the possibility that the flares hosted a jet identical to Sw 1644+57, the first and best-sampled relativistic TDF.  Conclusions: We thus obtain evidence for a dichotomy in the stellar tidal disruption population, implying that the jet launching mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the disruption.},

	Abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z\~{}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z\~{}20 from high-? density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until 
the present in a ?CDM cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1<z<5. A scheme for describing the hardening of a BH binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing <\~{}10 percent to the 
total BH mass density, ?SMBH=4?105 Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary SMBHs in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10 percent today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than 0.1L*) instead is less than 0.3 percent at all epochs. The nuclear SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 ? (4 ?) density peaks at z=20.},

	Abstract = {Only a small fraction of local galaxies harbor an accreting black hole, classified as an active galactic nucleus. However, many stellar systems are plausibly expected to host black holes, from globular clusters to nuclear star clusters, to massive galaxies. The mere presence of stars in the vicinity of a black hole provides a source of fuel via mass loss of evolved stars. In this paper, we assess the expected luminosities of black holes embedded in stellar systems of different sizes and properties, spanning a large range of masses. We model the distribution of stars and derive the amount of gas available to a central black hole through a geometrical model. We estimate the luminosity of the black holes under simple, but physically grounded, assumptions on the accretion flow. Finally, we discuss the detectability of "quiescent" black holes in the local universe.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the massive stars in OB associations and their surrounding interstellar medium environment, using a population synthesis code.   Methods: We developed a new population synthesis code for groups of massive stars, where we model the emission of different forms of energy and matter from the stars of the association. In particular, the ejection of the two radioactive isotopes 26Al and 60Fe is followed, as well as the emission of hydrogen ionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the stellar winds and supernova explosions. We investigate various alternative astrophysical inputs and the resulting output sensitivities, especially effects due to the inclusion of rotation in stellar models. As the aim of the code is the application to relatively small populations of massive stars, special care is taken to address their statistical properties. Our code incorporates both analytical statistical methods applicable to small populations, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations.   Results: We find that the inclusion of rotation in the stellar models has a large impact on the interactions between OB associations and their surrounding interstellar medium. The emission of 26Al in the stellar winds is strongly enhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the same mass-loss prescription. This compensates the recent reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates of massive stars due to the effects of clumping. Despite the lower mass-loss rates, the power of the winds is actually enhanced for rotating stellar models. The supernova power (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longer lifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power dominates over supernova power for the first 6 Myr after a burst of star-formation. For populations typical of nearby star-forming regions, the statistical uncertainties are large and clearly non-Gaussian.},

	Abstract = {We compute rates of tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, using downwardly revised black hole masses from the MBH-sigma relation. In galaxies with steep nuclear density profiles, which dominate the overall event rate, the disruption frequency varies inversely with assumed black hole mass. We compute a total rate for nondwarf galaxies of ~10-5 yr-1 Mpc-3, about a factor of 10 higher than in earlier studies. Disruption rates are predicted to be highest in nucleated dwarf galaxies, assuming that such galaxies contain black holes. Monitoring of a rich galaxy cluster for a few years could rule out the existence of intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies is expected to produce unique emission-line signatures, which have not yet been explored adequately. Here we report the discovery of extremely strong coronal lines from [Fe X] up to [Fe XIV] in a sample of seven galaxies (including two recently reported cases), which we interpret as such signatures. This is the first systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use of the immense database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxies, which are non-active as evidenced by the narrow line ratios, show broad emission lines of complex profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the high-ionization coronal lines and the broad lines are fading on timescales of years in objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolute magnitudes of at least -16 to -18 mag in the g band, are also detected in more than half of the sample. The coronal line emitters reside in sub-L * disk galaxies (-21.3 < Mi < -18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions. The sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence of the [Fe VII] lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [O III], [Fe XI], and the host galaxies. These characteristics can most naturally be understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate-mass black holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such events to be around 10-5 yr-1 for a galaxy with -21.3 < Mi < -18.5.},

	Abstract = {The tidal interaction of a protoplanet with a circumstellar gaseous disk results in mutual angular momentum exchange that modifies both the disk and the orbit of the secondary. There are two, conceptually distinct circumstances wherein nebula torques can cause a secular variation in a protoplanet's semimajor axis. (I) The net torque exerted on a secondary by an undisturbed disk is not, in general, zero. Although gradients in the disk density and temperature can contribute to this torque, it is mostly due to asymmetries in the disk/planet interaction that are inherent to a Keplerian disk. For a relatively thick disk, the differential torque can be a significant fraction of the torque from either its exterior or its interior portion. In this case, the protoplanet drifts relative to disk material on a time scale inversely proportional to its mass. (II) The protoplanet opens a gap in the disk that establishes a flow barrier to disk material. A density discontinuity that locks the protoplanet into the 
disk's viscous evolution develops across the orbit. The protoplanet migrates on a time scale set by the disk's viscosity. A unified model that clarifies the relationship between these migration types and reveals under what circumstances a given type is selected is presented. In both cases, orbital decay is the prevailing outcome, although type I migration rates can be between one and two orders of magnitudes faster than type II. Estimates of orbital lifetimes are given and are generally shorter than the expected lifetime of the disk. Some implications to the issue of planetary formation are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The mass of supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies is tightly correlated with the mass of the galaxy bulges which host them. This observed correlation implies a mechanism of joint growth, but the precise physical processes responsible are a matter of some debate. Here, we report on the growth of black holes in 400 local galactic bulges which have experienced a strong burst of star formation in the past 600Myr. The black holes in our sample have typical masses of 106.5-107.5Msolar and the active nuclei have bolometric luminosities of the order of 1042-1044ergs-1. We combine stellar continuum indices with Halpha luminosities to measure a decay time-scale of ~300Myr for the decline in star formation after a starburst. During the first 600Myr after a starburst, the black holes in our sample increase their mass by on-average 5 per cent and the total mass of stars formed is about 103 times the total mass accreted on to the black hole. This ratio is similar to the ratio of stellar to black hole mass observed in present-day bulges. We find that the average rate of accretion of matter on to the black hole rises steeply roughly 250Myr after the onset of the starburst. We show that our results are consistent with a simple model in which 0.5 per cent of the mass lost by intermediate-mass stars in the bulge is accreted by the black hole, but with a suppression in the efficiency of black hole growth at early times plausibly caused by supernova feedback, which is stronger at earlier times. We suggest this picture may be more generally applicable to black hole growth, and could help explain the strong correlation between bulge and black hole mass.},

	Abstract = {Over the past few years, our understanding of hot accretion flows has been improved significantly by two findings: (i) only a small fraction of the accretion flow available at the outer boundary can finally fall on to the black hole, while most of it is lost in the outflow; (ii) electrons can directly receive a large fraction of the viscously dissipated energy in the accretion flow (i.e. delta ˜ 0.1-0.5). The radiative efficiency of the hot accretion flow when these two findings are taken into account has not yet been systematically studied, and this is the subject of our paper. We consider two regimes of the hot accretion model: advection-dominated accretion flows that lie in the regime of the low accretion rate, ≲10alpha2L Edd /c2, and the luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) that lie above this accretion rate. For the LHAFs, we assume that the accretion flow has a two-phase structure above a certain accretion rate, and we adopt a simplification in our calculation of the dynamics. Our results indicate that the radiative efficiency of hot accretion flow increases with the accretion rate and that it is greatly enhanced by the direct viscous heating to electrons, compared to the previous case of delta ≪ 1. When the accretion rate is high, the radiative efficiency of the hot accretion flow is comparable to that of a standard thin disc. We present fitting formulae of radiative efficiency as a function of accretion rate for various values of delta.},

	Abstract = {We present results of follow-up optical spectroscopic Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) observations of seven rare, extreme coronal line-emitting galaxies reported by Wang et al. Large variations in coronal lines are found in four objects, making them strong candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). For the four TDE candidates, all the coronal lines with ionization states higher than [Fe VII] disappear within 5-9 yr. The [Fe VII] line faded by a factor of about five in one object (J0952+2143) within 4 yr, whereas the line emerged in another two objects that previously did not show the line. A strong increment in the [O III] flux is observed, shifting the line ratios toward the loci of active galactic nuclei on the BPT diagram. Surprisingly, we detect a non-canonical [O III] lambda5007/[O III] lambda4959 ratio of ~= 2 in two objects, indicating a large column density of O2 + and thus probably optically thick gas. This result also requires a very large ionization parameter and a relatively soft ionizing spectral energy distribution (e.g., a blackbody with T < 5 × 104 K). Our observations can be explained as the echoing of a strong ultraviolet to soft X-ray flare caused by TDEs on molecular clouds in the inner parsecs of the galactic nuclei. Reanalyzing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra reveals double-peaked or strongly blue-shouldered broad lines in three of the objects, which disappeared in the MMT spectra of two objects and faded by a factor of 10 in 8 yr in the remaining object with a decrease in both the line width and centroid offset. We interpret these broad lines as arising from decelerating biconical outflows. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of echoing can persist for as long as 10 yr and can be used to probe the gas environment in quiescent galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {We present continued multi-frequency radio observations of the relativistic tidal disruption event Swift J164449.3+573451 (Sw 1644+57) extending to t ≈ 600 days. The data were obtained with the JVLA and AMI Large Array as part of our on-going study of the jet energetics and the density structure of the parsec-scale environment around the disrupting supermassive black hole. We combine these data with public Swift/XRT and Chandra X-ray observations over the same time-frame to show that the jet has undergone a dramatic transition starting at ≈500 days, with a sharp decline in the X-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a timescale of deltat/t <~ 0.2 (and by a factor of 15 in deltat/t ≈ 0.05). The rapid decline rules out a forward shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the X-ray emission at <~ 500 days, and instead points to internal dissipation in the inner jet. On the other hand, our radio data uniquely demonstrate that the low X-ray flux measured by Chandra at ≈610 days is consistent with emission from the forward shock. Furthermore, the Chandra data are inconsistent with thermal emission from the accretion disk itself since the expected temperature of ~30-60 eV and inner radius of ~2-10 Rs cannot accommodate the observed flux level or the detected emission at >~ 1 keV. We associate the rapid decline with a turn off of the relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below ˜\dot{M}_Edd ≈ 0.006 M &sun; yr-1 (for a 3 × 106 M &sun; black hole and order unity efficiency) indicating that the peak accretion rate was about 330 \dot{M}_Edd, and the total accreted mass by t ≈ 500 days is about 0.15 M &sun;. From the radio data we further find significant flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at t >~ 250 days with E j, iso ≈ 2 × 1054 erg (Ej ≈ 1052 erg for a jet opening angle, theta j  = 0.1) following a rise by about a factor of 15 at ≈30-250 days. Projecting forward, we predict that the emission in the radio and X-ray bands will evolve in tandem with similar decline rates.},

@article{Zauderer+2011,
	Abstract = {Active galactic nuclei, which are powered by long-term accretion onto central supermassive black holes, produce relativistic jets with lifetimes of at least one million years, and the observation of the birth of such a jet is therefore unlikely. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole, for example through the tidal disruption of a stray star, thus offers a rare opportunity to study the birth of a relativistic jet. On 25 March 2011, an unusual transient source (Swift J164449.3+573451) was found, potentially representing such an accretion event. Here we report observations spanning centimetre to millimetre wavelengths and covering the first month of evolution of a luminous radio transient associated with Swift J164449.3+573451. The radio transient coincides with the nucleus of an inactive galaxy. We conclude that we are seeing a newly formed relativistic outflow, launched by transient accretion onto a million-solar-mass black hole. A relativistic outflow is not predicted in this situation, but we show that the tidal disruption of a star naturally explains the observed high-energy properties and radio luminosity and the inferred rate of such events. The weaker beaming in the radio-frequency spectrum relative to gamma-rays or X-rays suggests that radio searches may uncover similar events out to redshifts of z~6.},

	Abstract = {In this second paper, in a series of two, we determine the properties of the stellar torus that we showed in the first paper to result as a product of two merging black holes. If the surrounding stellar cluster is as massive as the binary black hole, the torque acting on the stars ejects a fraction which extracts the binary's angular momentum. After the black holes coalesced on scales of \~{} 107ut \{yr\}, a geometrically thick torus remained. In the present article we show that a certain fraction of the stars has winds, shaped into elongated tails by the central radiation pressure, which are optically thick for line of sights aligned with them. These stars are sufficiently numerous to achieve a covering factor of 1, so that the complete torus is optically thick. This patchy structured torus is then compared with observations. We find the parameters of such a torus to be just in the right range in order to explain the observed large column densities in AGN and their temporal variations on time 
scales of about a decade. Within this model the broad absorption line quasars can be interpreted as quasars seen at intermediate inclination angles, with the line of sight grazing the edge of the torus. The half-opening angle of the torus is wider for major mergers and thus correlates with the central luminosity, as has been suggested previously. In this picture the spin of the merged black hole is possibly dominated by the orbital angular momentum of the binary. Thus the spin of the merged black hole points into a new direction, and consequently the jet experiences a spin-flip according to the spin-paradigm. This re-orientation could be an explanation for the X-shaped radio galaxies, and the advancing of a new jet through the ambient medium for Compact Symmetric Objects.},

@article{Zubovas+2014,
	Abstract = {It is usually assumed that outflows from luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN) are either in the energy-conserving (non-radiative) or in the momentum-conserving (radiative) regime. We show that in a non-spherical geometry the effects of both regimes may manifest at the same time, and that it is the momentum of the outflow that sets the MBH-sigma relation. Considering an initially elliptical distribution of gas in the host galaxy, we show that a non-radiative outflow opens up a wide `escape route' over the paths of least resistance. Most of the outflow energy escapes in that direction. At the same time, in the directions of higher resistance, the ambient gas is affected mainly by the incident momentum from the outflow. Quenching SMBH growth requires quenching gas delivery along the paths of highest resistance, and therefore, it is the momentum of the outflow that limits the black hole growth. We present an analytical argument showing that such energy-conserving feedback bubbles driving leaky ambient shells will terminate SMBH growth once its mass reaches roughly the Msigma mass derived earlier by King for momentum-conserving AGN outflows. Our simulations also have potentially important implications for observations of AGN jet feedback and starburst galaxy feedback. The collimation of the wide angle AGN outflow away from the symmetry plane, as found in our simulations, indicates that credit for work done by such outflows may sometimes be mistakenly given to AGN jets or star formation feedback since wide angle v ˜ 0.1c outflows are harder to observe and the phase when they are present may be short.},

We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to study the tidal disruption of stars by such a binary in the final centuries of its life. We find that the gas stream of the stellar debris moves chaotically in the binary potential and forms accretion disks around both black holes. The accretion light curve is modulated over the binary orbital period owing to relativistic beaming. This periodic signal allows to detect the decay of the binary orbit due to gravitational wave emission by observing two tidal disruption events that are separated by more than a decade.},

@article{Carson+2015,
	Abstract = {We obtained Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging of a sample of ten of the nearest and brightest nuclear clusters (NCs) residing in late-type spiral galaxies, in seven bands that span the near-UV to the near-IR. Structural properties of the clusters were measured by fitting two-dimensional surface brightness profiles to the images using GALFIT. The clusters exhibit a wide range of structural properties, with F814W absolute magnitudes that range from -11.2 to -15.1 mag and F814W effective radii that range from 1.4 to 8.3 pc. For 6 of the 10 clusters in our sample, we find changes in the effective radius with wavelength, suggesting radially varying stellar populations. In four of the objects, the effective radius increases with wavelength, indicating the presence of a younger population that is more concentrated than the bulk of the stars in the cluster. However, we find a general decrease in effective radius with wavelength in two of the objects in our sample, which may indicate extended, circumnuclear star formation. We also find a general trend of increasing roundness of the clusters at longer wavelengths, as well as a correlation between the axis ratios of the NCs and their host galaxies. These observations indicate that blue disks aligned with the host galaxy plane are a common feature of NCs in late-type galaxies, but are difficult to detect in galaxies that are close to face-on. In color--color diagrams spanning the near-UV through the near-IR, most of the clusters lie far from single-burst evolutionary tracks, showing evidence for multi-age populations. Most of the clusters have integrated colors consistent with a mix of an old population (>1 Gyr) and a young population (~100--300 Myr). The wide wavelength coverage of our data provides a sensitivity to populations with a mix of ages that would not be possible to achieve with imaging in optical bands only. The surface brightness profiles presented in this work will be used for future stellar population modeling and dynamical studies of the clusters.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-12163.},

@article{Shiokawa+2015,
	Abstract = {We study how the matter dispersed when a supermassive black hole tidally disrupts a star joins an accretion flow. Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of the subsequent debris motion, we track the evolution of such a system until ~= 80% of the stellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most tightly bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make its characteristic radius comparable to the semimajor axis of the most bound material, not the tidal radius as previously envisioned. The outer shocks are caused by post-Newtonian relativistic effects, both on the stellar orbit during its disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion flow is both non-monotonic and slow, requiring several to 10 times the orbital period of the most tightly bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by shocks does, however, cause some mass to lose both angular momentum and energy, permitting it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the accretion flow. Although the accretion rate still rises sharply and then decays roughly as a power law, its maximum is ~= 0.1×  the previous expectation, and the timescale of the peak is ~= 5×  longer than previously predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event timescale is therefore ~= 0.2×  the value given by classical theory.},

@article{Guillochon+2015b,
	Abstract = {Main-sequence disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes result in the production of an extended, geometrically thin debris stream winding repeatedly around the black hole. In the absence of black hole spin, in-plane relativistic precession causes this stream to intersect with itself after a single winding. In this paper we show that relativistic precessions arising from black hole spin can induce deflections out of the original orbital plane that prevent the stream from self-intersecting even after many windings. This naturally leads to a ``dark period'' in which the flare is not observable for some time, persisting for up to a dozen orbital periods of the most bound material, which translates to years for disruptions around black holes with masses ~ {10}7{M}o . When the stream eventually self-intersects, the distance from the black hole and the angle at which this collision occurs determine the rate of energy dissipation. We find that more-massive black holes ({M}{{h}}≳ {10}7{M}o ) tend to have more violent stream self-intersections, resulting in prompt accretion. For these tidal disruption events (TDEs), the accretion rate onto the black hole should still closely follow the original fallback rate after a fixed delay time {t}{delay}, {\dot{M}}{acc}(t+{t}{delay})={\dot{M}}{fb}(t). For lower black hole masses ({M}{{h}}≲ {10}6), we find that flares are typically slowed down by about an order of magnitude, resulting in the majority of TDEs being sub-Eddington at peak. This also implies that current searches for TDEs are biased toward prompt flares, with slowed flares likely having been unidentified.},

	Abstract = {A tidal disruption event (TDE) takes place when a star passes near enough to a massive black hole to be disrupted. About half the star's matter is given elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, and the other half is unbound. To form an accretion flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole's gravitational radius (~ {{10}51}{{(R/1000{{R}g})}-1} erg). Recent numerical simulations have revealed that the accretion flow scale is close to the scale of the most bound initial orbits, ~ {{10}3}MBH,6.5-2/3{{R}g}~ {{10}15}MBH,6.51/3 cm from the black hole, and the corresponding energy dissipation rate is ~ {{10}44}MBH,6.5-1/6 erg s-1. We suggest that the energy liberated during the formation of the accretion disk, rather than the energy liberated by subsequent accretion onto the black hole, powers the observed optical TDE candidates. The observed rise times, luminosities, temperatures, emission radii, and line widths seen in these TDEs are all more readily explained in terms of heating associated with disk formation rather than in terms of accretion.},

	Abstract = {We calculate steady-state, one-dimensional hydrodynamic profiles of hot gas in slowly accreting (`quiescent') galactic nuclei for a range of central black hole masses M*, parametrized gas heating rates, and observationally motivated stellar density profiles. Mass is supplied to the circumnuclear medium by stellar winds, while energy is injected primarily by stellar winds, supernovae, and black hole feedback. Analytic estimates are derived for the stagnation radius (where the radial velocity of the gas passes through zero) and the large-scale gas inflow rate, dot{M}, as a function of M* and the gas heating efficiency, the latter being related to the star formation history. We assess the conditions under which radiative instabilities develop in the hydrostatic region near the stagnation radius, both in the case of a single burst of star formation and for the average star formation history predicted by cosmological simulations. By combining a sample of measured nuclear X-ray luminosities, LX, of nearby quiescent galactic nuclei with our results for dot{M}(M_{bullet }), we address whether the nuclei are consistent with accreting in a steady state, thermally stable manner for radiative efficiencies predicted for radiatively inefficiency accretion flows. We find thermally stable accretion cannot explain the short average growth times of low-mass black holes in the local Universe, which must instead result from gas being fed in from large radii, due either to gas inflows or thermal instabilities acting on larger, galactic scales. Our results have implications for attempts to constrain the occupation fraction of upermassive black holes in low-mass galaxies using the mean LX-M* correlation, as well as the predicted diversity of the circumnuclear densities encountered by relativistic outflows from tidal disruption events.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of Swift J1112.2-8238, and identify it as a candidate relativistic tidal disruption flare. The outburst was first detected by Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) in 2011 June as an unknown, long-lived (order of days) gamma-ray transient source. We show that its position is consistent with the nucleus of a faint galaxy for which we establish a likely redshift of z = 0.89 based on a single emission line that we interpret as the blended [O II] lambda3727 doublet. At this redshift, the peak X-ray/gamma-ray luminosity exceeded 1047 erg s-1, while a spatially coincident optical transient source had i' ˜ 22 (Mg ˜ -21.4 at z = 0.89) during early observations, ˜20 d after the Swift trigger. These properties place Swift J1112.2-8238 in a very similar region of parameter space to the two previously identified members of this class, Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+0516. As with those events the high-energy emission shows evidence for variability over the first few days, while late-time observations, almost 3 yr post-outburst, demonstrate that it has now switched off. Swift J1112.2-8238 brings the total number of such events observed by Swift to three, interestingly all detected by Swift over a ˜3 month period (<3 per cent of its total lifetime as of 2015 March). While this suggests the possibility that further examples may be uncovered by detailed searches of the BAT archives, the lack of any prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events are undoubtedly rare.},

@article{Guillochon+2015a,
	Abstract = {The kinetic energy of a star in orbit about a supermassive black hole is a significant fraction of its rest mass energy when its periapse is comparable to its tidal radius. Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted and injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the black hole, with the fastest material moving at $\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper, we present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams (UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding gas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that hydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the densest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs travel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with distance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the ambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This sudden injection of $\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a Sedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs) in energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic rays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the molecular clouds surrounding a black hole. We estimate that a few of these UDRs might be present within a couple degrees of the Galactic Center masquerading as SNRs, and that the UDR scenario is a plausible explanation for Sgr A East.},

	Abstract = {Was PS1-10jh (Gezari et al. 2012), an optical/UV transient discovered by the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey, the tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole? We address two aspects of the problem: the composition of the putative disrupted object (using the spectroscopic data), and the energetics of the observed gas and radiation (using the photometric data). We perform photoionization calculations and compare with the observed lower limit of the line ratio L(He II 4686)/L(Halpha) > 5 to argue that this event was not the disruption of a solar-type star, and instead was likely the disruption of a helium core (as first proposed by Gezari et al. 2012). Disruption of such a dense object requires a relatively small central BH, M_BH <~ 2 x 10^5 M_sun. We use the photometric data to infer that PS1-10jh comprised an outflow of ~ 0.01 M_sun of gas, escaping from the BH at ~1000 km/s, and we propose that this outflow was driven primarily by radiation pressure trapped by Thomson and resonance line scattering. The large ratio of radiated energy to kinetic energy, E_rad/E_K ~ 10^4, together with the large value of E_rad ~ 2 x 10^(51) erg, suggests that the outflow was shocked at large radius (perhaps similar to super-luminous supernovae or the internal shock model for gamma-ray bursts). We describe puzzles in the physics of PS1-10jh, and discuss how this event may help us understand future tidal disruptions and super-Eddington accretion events as well.},

	Abstract = {The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) is a highly energetic event with consequences dependent on the degree to which the star plunges inside the SMBH's tidal sphere. We introduce a new analytic model for tidal disruption events (TDEs) to analyse the dependence of these events on beta, the ratio of the tidal radius to the orbital pericentre. We find, contrary to most previous work, that the spread in debris energy for a TDE is largely constant for all beta. This result has important consequences for optical transient searches targeting TDEs, which we discuss. We quantify leading-order general relativistic corrections to this spread in energy and find that they are small. We also examine the role of stellar spin and find that a combination of spin-orbit misalignment, rapid rotation and high beta may alter the spread in debris energy. Finally, we quantify for the first time the gravitational wave emission due to the strong compression of a star in a high-beta TDE. Although this signal is unlikely to be detectable for disruptions of main-sequence stars, the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate mass black hole can produce a strong signal visible to Advanced LIGO at tens of megaparsecs.},

	Abstract = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift z ~ 0.4. Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate \dot{M}(t), the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in \dot{M}(t) shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as extreme as -4 in the months immediately following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to ~= - 2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = -5/3. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as functions of the star's distance to the black hole at pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost, the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal disruptions are modeled.},

@article{Korista+2000,
	Abstract = {In recent work Baldwin et al. proposed that in the geometrically extended broad-line regions (BLRs) of quasars and active galactic nuclei, a range in line-emitting gas properties (e.g., density, column density) might exist at each radius and showed that under these conditions the broad emission line spectra of these objects may be dominated by selection effects introduced by the atomic physics and general radiative transfer within the large pool of line-emitting entities. In this picture, the light we see originates in a vast amalgam of emitters but is dominated by those emitters best able to reprocess the incident continuum into a particular emission line. We test this ``locally optimally emitting clouds'' (LOC) model against the extensive spectroscopic database of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. The time-averaged, integrated-light UV broad emission line spectrum from the 1993 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) monitoring campaign is reproduced via the optimization of three global geometric parameters: the outer radius, the index controlling the radial cloud covering fraction of the continuum source, and the integrated cloud covering fraction. We make an ad hoc selection from the range of successful models, and for a simple spherical BLR geometry we simulate the emission-line light curves for the 1989 IUE and 1993 HST campaigns, using the respective observed UV continuum light curves as drivers. We find good agreement between the predicted and observed light curves and lags-a demonstration of the LOC picture's viability as a means to understanding the BLR environment. Finally, we discuss the next step in developing the LOC picture, which involves the marriage of echo-mapping techniques with spectral simulation grids such as those presented here, using the constraints provided by a high-quality, temporally well-sampled spectroscopic data set.},
